In Fiji, we do not use ImageJ directly, as we need some special enhancements, or we have some features early that then trickle into ImageJ.  And so we got a number of enhancements in our current version of ImageJA in addition to synchronizing with the ImageJ version 1.42q:

* When a duplicate menu entry was found, the message is more helpful now: it says which ''.jar'' file the conflict stems from.
* {{bc | Help | Update ImageJ...}} was reenabled, fixing a bug on MacOSX.
* {{bc | Plugins | Utilities | Find Commands...}} now shows the .jar file too when full info is displayed.

The update is available via {{bc | Help | Update Fiji}} (as ''ij.jar'').
