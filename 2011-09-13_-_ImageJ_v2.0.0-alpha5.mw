Today we are releasing a fifth alpha of ImageJ2, version 2.0.0-alpha5. This is an "alpha"-quality release, meaning the code is not finished, nor is the design fully stabilized. We are releasing it for early community feedback, and to demonstrate project directions and progress.

Unfortunately, the code is still not far enough along to be called "beta," as we are still working through some remaining design issues as well as strengthening compatibility with ImageJ v1.x.

DO NOT USE THIS RELEASE FOR ANYTHING IMPORTANT.

For this release, like previous alpha releases, we have tried to model the application after ImageJ v1.x as much as is reasonable. However, please be aware that version 2.0.0 is essentially a total rewrite of ImageJ from the ground up. It provides backward compatibility with older versions of ImageJ by bundling the latest v1.x code and translating between "legacy" and "modern" image structures.

ImageJ v2.0.0-alpha5 has made substantial progress in many areas:

* Architecture changes that make possible future features:
** Better dynamic menu management.
** Tracking of recently opened files.
** Tracking of open windows.
** MDI/SDI display implementations.
** Always active tools.
* New features:
** Improved support for legacy commands.
** Plugins respect ROI bounding boxes.
** Improved animation support.
* Numerous bugfixes related to:
** Threading issues.
** Memory leaks.
** Better legacy interactions.

For further details on the release, see the <code>README.txt</code> file included with the distribution.
