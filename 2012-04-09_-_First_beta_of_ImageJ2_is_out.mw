The first beta of the [[ImageJ2|next generation of ImageJ]] is out! From the announcement:

:Today, the ImageJDev team is proud to release the first beta of ImageJ2, version 2.0.0-beta1!
:
:ImageJ 2.0.0-beta1 is a "beta"-quality release, meaning the code is not finished. The design is more stable than before but still subject to change until the final 2.0.0 release. It is recommended that people continue to use ImageJ v1.x for critical work.

:
:The ImageJ2 user interface is modeled after ImageJ v1.x as much as possible. However, under the hood, ImageJ2 is a complete redesign of ImageJ. It provides backward compatibility with older versions of ImageJ by bundling the latest v1.x code and translating between "legacy" and "modern" image structures.

ImageJ2 is slated to become the new core of Fiji (since ImageJ2 is going to be almost 100% backwards-compatible with ImageJ1).
