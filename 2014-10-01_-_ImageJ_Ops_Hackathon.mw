From Sunday, September 14, 2014 through Friday, September 19, 2014, LOCI in Madison hosted Christian Dietz and Brian Northan, two developers of [[ImageJ Ops]], for an exciting hackathon. [http://www.informatik.uni-konstanz.de/en/berthold/members/christian-dietz/ Christian Dietz] is a PhD student in computer science at the University of Konstanz and the lead developer of the [http://knime.imagej.net/ KNIME Image Processing] project; [https://www.linkedin.com/pub/brian-northan/6/860/3a7 Brian Northan] is a freelance contract research and development engineer specializing in scientific image and signal processing.

== Overview ==

ImageJ Ops is an extensible Java framework for algorithms, particularly image processing algorithms. Ops seeks to be a unifying library for scientific image processing. See the [https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/wiki/Motivation Motivation] page on the Ops wiki for details.

[[KNIME]] is an open source data analytics, reporting and integration platform, which integrates various components for machine learning and data mining through its modular data pipelining concept. The [http://knime.imagej.net/ '''KN'''IME '''I'''mage '''P'''rocessing] extension, KNIP, provides nodes for working with images, and is built on the ImageJ Ops library. Ops makes it possible to execute the image processing algorithm in many contexts, including from within [[ImageJ]] itself, from [[OMERO]], [[KNIME]], [[CellProfiler]] and beyond.

== Accomplishments ==

This hackathon focused on the [[ImageJ Ops]] library, adding support for key image processing operations, as well as improving the framework itself. Achievements from the hackathon include:

* Vastly improved thresholding code ([https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/pull/52 #52])
* Improvements to the code generation mechanism ([https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/pull/42 #42])
* Autogeneration of base op interfaces ([https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/commit/e1e2d18fd1e96968c4a8aa29d1f67c46222167b6 e1e2d18f])
* Several miscellaneous design improvements ([https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/pull/36 #36], [https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/commit/6cb8b0831f9f3fb6d27bfcf2ee509ca20688b5c4 6cb8b083])
* See the [https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/compare/master@%7B13-Sep-2014%7D...master@%7B20-Sep-2014%7D SCM history] for full details.

All thresholding algorithms from [[ImageJ 1.x]] have been ported to Ops. Available thresholding methods now include:

{|
|
* huang
* ij1
* intermodes
|
* isodata
* li
* maxEntropy
|
* maxlikelihood
* mean
* minerror
|
* minimum
* moments
* otsu
|
* percentile
* renyientropy
* shanbhag
| style="vertical-align: top" |
* triangle
* yen

|}

== Progress and future directions ==

We also made great progress on several new lines of development:
* Type conversion ([https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/pull/47 #47])
* Kernels ([https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/pull/48 #48])
* Projection ([https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/pull/51 #51])
* Conditions ([https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/pull/73 #73])
* Features and descriptors ([https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/compare/feature-service feature-service branch])

== Future directions ==

The Ops development plan and timeline is now [https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/milestones codified on GitHub]. Major milestones include:

# A [https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/milestones/0.10.0 near-term release] later this fall: high-priority design issues, features and ops.
# An [https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/milestones/0.20.0 intermediate release] before next spring: work to complete before coming out of incubation with 1.0.0, but less urgent than near-term items.
# A [https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/milestones/1.0.0 stable 1.0.0 release] before the end of 2015: first release with a goal of future backwards compatibility according to [http://semver.org/ SemVer].

Thanks to everyone involved for all the hard work, patience and enthusiasm!
