== What's new ==

First pass to reduce [[SCIFIO]] overhead:
* Fixed a bug resulting in 2-second timeouts when calling SCIFIO from a macro ([https://github.com/imagej/imagej-legacy/commit/b83c41e532ff5e17c9cb57ee93188b2b4dae0bba b83c41e5]).
* Improved caching of common data (boosts performance throughout ImageJ2) ([https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/compare/7ae4103ac2d4503a6291c73dd3cd90f16656e821%5E...240512492ea754576819e681d1d79ce1db5270c3 7ae4103a...24051249]).
* SCIFIO configurations use more sensible defaults, favoring performance.
* For some highly unscientific benchmarks of performance, see right.

First wave of improvements from 2015-01 Konstanz [[ImageJ-OPS]] [[hackathon]]
* Better op code generation layer via Groovy parser ([https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/commit/c51ce639261c78922ff461267fd6e0e4522e85eb c51ce639]).
* Divide built-in op implementations into namespaces ([https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/commit/4e4a9e2fc55736dfa96316f77c575bd46afda59f 4e4a9e2f]).
* Improve the project's build time ([https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/commit/1c9d1d05f418c1019a7e8e0674bfa6ee53365752 1c9d1d05]).
* Better error messages when ops don't match ([https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/commit/4de825c6810eec43306093119dd6547b9c4d699c 4de825c6]).
* Support for unary & binary arithmetic with primitives ([https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/commit/af05aff6f628155d12352a0c5fabaec0843c8d8b af05aff6]).
* New kernel implementations + FFT ops ([https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/commit/6c01f0ba6e67f21814c876f05d3bd490c7286a1e 6c01f0ba], [https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/commit/61062163bd4049348e78354a28371bf56d90e1ac 61062163], [https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/commit/e5567c3e92fec104a13fa619317a597312831687 e5567c3e]).

Updated messages for Refresh Menus & related commands to be more user-friendly (hopefully).

== What's next ==

Looking ahead at short-term goals:
* Fixes/improvements for command-line functionality.
* More SCIFIO performance improvements.
* An automated troubleshooter to improve the average user experience.
