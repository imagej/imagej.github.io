Recent versions of OS X have seen a radical shift in how Java works. Apple no longer ships their own version of Java, but instead recommends users install Oracle's Java 7 or Java 8 runtime themselves. In recent years, these changes have made ImageJ deployment on OS X more difficult.

Fortunately, the ImageJ team is happy to announce that [[ImageJ2]] now behaves better on recent versions of OS X:
* The ImageJ [[Launcher]] now makes a best effort to use the newest installed version of Java.
* You no longer have to install Java 6 just to run ImageJ—it is enough to just install Java 8.
* A [https://github.com/imagej/imagej-launcher/commit/4e1e688906d140c3ea6313ca2a0f9cc3b5879644 critical bug] was fixed preventing Java platform extensions (in particular, [[JavaScript]]) from working properly on OS X with Java 7 and 8.

There may still be some kinks to iron out. If you are running OS X, please update your installation and [[Mailing Lists|let us know]] how it works for you!
