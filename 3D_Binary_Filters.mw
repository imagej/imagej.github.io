== Purpose ==
A 3D version of binary filters like erode and dilate.

== Description ==
These plugins require an 8-bit image and apply the corresponding
filter to the specified iso-value.

The applied kernel has a diameter of 3 voxels.

The image below shows the effect of the 'Erode' and 'Dilate' filters, using the Bat Cochlea image which
comes as one of ImageJ's and Fiji's sample images. Both filters are applied three times, to make the
effect clearer.
