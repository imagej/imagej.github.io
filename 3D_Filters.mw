== 3D Filters ==
3D filtering using ellipsoidal neighbourhood.

== Author ==
Thomas Boudier

Matthias Labschütz contributed a fast version for isotropic kernels (for min, max and mean filtering)

== Description ==

The plugin performs 3D filtering on image stacks. The kernel is ellipsoidal, you can then select three radii for X, Y, and Z. Note that the plugin uses parallel implementation, and a very fast version using //rolling ball// algorithm is used for isotropic kernel (all three radii equal). 

The 3D filters mean, median, variance, min and max are implemented in ImageJ since version 1.47.


Available filters :

* Mean and variance filtering

* Minimum and maximum filtering

* Local maxima

* TopHat transform (to detect spots-like objects)

* Sobel (simple edge detection)

* Adaptive Nagao-like
