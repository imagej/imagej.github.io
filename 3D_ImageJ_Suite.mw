== 3D ImageJ Suite ==
This ''suite'' provides plugins to enhance 3D capabilities of ImageJ.

Slowly migrating contents from [https://imagejdocu.list.lu/plugin/stacks/3d_ij_suite/start 3D Suite on ImageJ Documentation Website]. 

Help welcomed :-) .

== Author ==
Thomas Boudier  [[File:EmailBoudier.png]], [https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en Academia Sinica], Taipei, Taiwan.

With many contributions from J. Ollion, Laboratoire Jean Perrin, Paris, France.

== Features ==
This ''suite'' is composed of : 

* [[3D Filters]] (mean, median, max, min, tophat, max local, ...) and [[Edge and symmetry filter]]
* [[3D Segmentation]] (iterative thresholding, spots segmentation, watershed, ...)
* [https://imagejdocu.list.lu/plugin/morphology/3d_mathematical_morphology_/start 3D Mathematical Morphology] tools (fill holes, binary closing, distance map, ...)
* [https://imagejdocu.list.lu/plugin/stacks/3d_roi_manager/start 3D RoiManager] (3D display and analysis of 3D objects)
* [https://imagejdocu.list.lu/plugin/analysis/3d_analysis/start 3D Analysis] (Geometrical measurements, Mesh measurements, Convex hull, ...)
* [https://imagejdocu.list.lu/plugin/analysis/3d_mereotopology/start 3D MereoTopology] (Relationship between objects)
* [https://imagejdocu.list.lu/plugin/stacks/3d_tools:start 3D Tools] (Drawing ellipsoids and lines, cropping, ...)

A 2D/3D [https://imagejdocu.list.lu/plugin/analysis/spatial_statistics_2d_3d/start spatial statistics] plugin is also available.

== Installation ==
From version 2.7, '''3D ImageJ Suite''' is available in Fiji as an [http://fiji.sc/List_of_update_sites Fiji update site]. The '''Java8''' and '''ImageScience''' update sites must be activated in Fiji, see instructions [https://imagej.net/Following_an_update_site here]]. 

You can also install '''3D ImageJ Suite''' manually (see download section) and unzip it in your plugins folder. The various plugins will appear in the menu '''3D''' of the plugins list.

You have also to manually download and copy into your plugins directory the '''imagescience.jar''' library from [http://www.imagescience.org/meijering/software/featurej/ here].

== Download ==
ImageJ 1.47 or later is required. Java3D is also required, check that [[3D_Viewer]] is working. 

'''NEW''' From version 3.83 and later, for ImageJ users the new version 4.0.1 of 3D_Viewer is required (please remove the 3D_Viewer plugin provided by ImageJ and replace it by [[Media:3d_viewer-mcib.zip]], just unzip the file in the plugins directory). 

Java 1.8 or later is required. '''The [http://www.imagescience.org/meijering/software/featurej/ imagescience] library is required ''' : [http://www.imagescience.org/meijering/software/download/imagescience.jar download here].
 
'''Bundle''' : [[Media:Mcib3d-3.96.zip]]
