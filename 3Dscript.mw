'''3Dscript''' - Create high-quality 3D/4D animations using a natural-language based syntax

In state-of-the-art 3D rendering and animation software the user typically creates an animation by specifying a number of keyframes. While intuitive, this approach becomes tedious for complex motions like simultaneous rotations around multiple axes, and even worse for accelerated and decelerated motions: The number of required keyframes increases, and creating them becomes hardly reproducible.

In 3Dscript, animations are defined by a syntax based on natural English language, in sentences such as "From frame 0 to frame 100 rotate by 360 degrees horizontally ease-in".

== Installation ==

* Click on Help>Update...
* Click on Manage update sites
* Click on Add update site
* Enter Name: 3Dscript
* Enter URL: https://romulus.oice.uni-erlangen.de/updatesite/
* Click on Close
* Click on Apply changes
* Restart Fiji 

== Quick start ==

* Click on File>Open Samples>T1 Head
* Click on Plugins>3D script>Interactive Animation
* In the "Interactive Raycaster" window, click on "show" next to "Animation"
* Click on "Start text-based animation editor"
* In the editor window, type the following text: From frame 0 to frame 200 rotate by 360 degrees horizontally
* Click on "Run" This will render 200 frames of a movie sequence, within which the MRI data set rotates by 360 degrees.


Rendering of 200 frames of this data set will typically take less than a minute on an OpenCL-enabled Graphics Card. The resulting stack can be saved as a video file using Fiji's File>Save As>AVI... command.

To run the software on another data set, open a different image stack (instead of the T1 Head sample data) before running 3Dscript.
