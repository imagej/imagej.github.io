{{Development | tutorials}}Before an image can be analyzed, it needs to be opened properly. The way scientific image data can be stored varies wildly - with custom formats as numerous as the different brands and models of instruments used in their acquisition. Therefore, supporting a wide variety of formats is critical to the success of an image analysis platform like ImageJ.{{ImageJ1 | With [[ImageJ 1.x]], a special [http://imagej.net/plugins/file-handler.html HandleExtraFileTypes] plugin exists that can be modified to support new data formats—but it has some significant disadvantages:

* It only provides limited extensibility: there can only be one <code>HandleExtraFileTypes</code> installed into ImageJ at a time, so all desired modifications to the plugin must be somehow combined. This makes it impossible to, for example, ship a different <code>HandleExtraFileTypes</code> on two different ImageJ [[Update Sites]] and have both additions be available in the same installation.
* Data formats added in this manner cannot override or extend ImageJ1's built in support for certain file formats. In particular, ImageJ1 supports only a subset of the TIFF specification, and this issue cannot be circumvented via <code>HandleExtraFileTypes</code> modifications.}}[[ImageJ2]] provides a comprehensive solution to the issue of data formats in the form of [[SCIFIO]] data format plugins. [[SCIFIO]], the SCientific Image Format Input and Output library, is a flexible framework for image format support. To get started writing SCIFIO formats:

* Check out the [https://github.com/scifio/scifio-tutorials/tree/master/core/src/main/java/io/scif/tutorials/core SCIFIO tutorials].
* Look at simple [https://github.com/scifio/scifio/blob/scifio-0.24.0/src/main/java/io/scif/formats/BMPFormat.java existing formats] for a starting point.
