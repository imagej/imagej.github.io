== Documentation ==

From the plugin inline help:

" <u>Align RGB planes</u> v1.7 by G.Landini
Changes the alignment of the RGB planes independently.

''Red'' ''Green'' and ''Blue'' checkboxes switch ON and OFF the
planes and undo the alignment since last plane change.
Note that when switching planes, the portion of the previously
edited plane left outside the image frame is lost.
Rotation, Width and Height changes are interpolated (so there is
some loss of sharpness) and do not retain the image portions
outside the image frame.  You can use the '''Resize2Rotate''' macro
to avoid loosing any image data.

The ''Rotate'', ''Width'' and ''Height'' sliders set integer values,
but fractional values can also be typed in the entry boxes.
Just make sure you press [RETURN] after the number is typed.

The ''Revert'' button works only with single images, not stacks.

Note: When using stacks, 2 buttons [< Prev] and [Next >] are added
to the panel. Do not use the slide bar in the stack window, but use
those buttons instead."
