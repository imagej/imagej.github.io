__NOTOC__{{Notice | For a summary of [[SciJava]] licensing, see the [[Licensing]] page.}}
{{LicensesMenu}}'''BSD licenses''' are a family of '''permissive''' [[Open Source|free software]] licenses, imposing minimal restrictions on the redistribution of covered software. This is in contrast to [[wikipedia:Copyleft|copyleft]] licenses like the [[GPL]], which have reciprocity share-alike requirements. The original BSD license was used for its namesake, the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), a Unix-like operating system. The original version has since been revised and its descendants are more properly termed modified BSD licenses.

See the [[wikipedia:BSD licenses|Wikipedia article on BSD licenses]] for more information.
