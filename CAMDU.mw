CAMDU ([http://www.warwick.ac.uk/camdu http://www.warwick.ac.uk/camdu]) is a "virtual facility" at the University of Warwick. We are home to multiple advanced light microscopes, both commercial and custom-built systems, alongside computational workstations, software development and integrated petabyte data storage. This includes our Wellcome-funded lattice light sheet microscope and visitor programme.

Currently, our Fiji update site offers the plugin autoQC for automating tasks related to microscope quality control.



== AutoQC ==

Usage Instructions:

'''autoPSF''': expects Z-stacks with sub-resolution fluorescent beads.   

'''autoFOV''': expects single 2d images of a fluorescent slide (uniform sample).  

'''autoColoc''': expects 4d images (XYCZT) of larger-than-resolution fluorescent beads.  

'''autoStageRepro''': expects 3d images (timelapse). Each timepoint should be recorded after translating the stage and moving it back to its original position.

If you're using files from multiple folders, outputs will be saved on the folder where the first file is.  

You can operate over multiseries files - the match string parameter tells the program what substring it should look for. For example, if you have a multiseries file and you wan to run autoPSF only over series containing "psf" on their names, use "psf" as the match string parameter.

Note that, for multiseries files (e.g. mvd2), the same calibration is used for all series - do not mix different objectives on the same file!    

When in doubt, consult the [http://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=plugin:analysis:metroloj:metroloj.pdf MetroloJ Manual] for detailed protocols.   

For OMERO stuff, you need the [https://www.openmicroscopy.org/omero/downloads/ OMERO Plugin for ImageJ].
