= CIP : Classic Image Processing =

Classic Image Processing (CIP) is an image procesing toolbox which provides functions for scripting in ImageJ. Its principal goal is to facilitate image analysis workflow construction as well as to provide an accessible entry point to learn the programming of such workflow. CIP philosophy in achieving that is to focus on providing a smooth user experience. We hope that this reflects in CIP main features:

* '''Integration''' to ImageJ ecosystem: CIP can be easily used in combination other ImageJ1 and ImageJ2 plugins. For instance, it can process seamlessly all usual imageJ image type (ImagePlus, Dataset, ImgPlus, Img) wihtout requiring any conversion.

* '''Discoverability''' of its functionnalities: CIP provides a complete user documentation that explain function usage, details their parameters and provides simple examples. In order to allow an intuitive learning, function parameters can be named or made optionnal while similar functions will have similar signatures. For the same reason 2D and 3D images can be processed with the same functions. 

* '''Simplicity''' of use: Learning programming is demanding, that is why CIP hides some of its difficulty. For instance CIP requires no class and package import. It Also uses only 3 main data type, Image, Region and Table, avoiding the need for complex data structure. Finally, CIP functions never modifies there inputs so you always know what is happening to your data.

* An '''essential''' set of tools: CIP gathers the 10% of tools that will get the job done, allowing one to go straight to the tool he needs. The function selected are also well adopted by the community to facilitate exchange and understanding. Finally, CIP provides basic visualisation and measure tools making autonomous in many use case.

=Tools categories=
Image analysis workflows require the user to perform stereotypic steps: enhance signal, define and characterize region, visualize and assess results. This recurring process allows to create one function per task and to organize these functions in categories with similar roles, input and output: Format, Filter, Segment, Math, Assess.

<div align="center">'''Figure 2''': Many analysis workflow are composed of generic tasks. </div>

* '''Format''': These functions are used to managed image data, combine them or reduce their dimensionnality. They take one or multiple image as input and return one image as output. These function will generally provide an ouput which size and/or dimensionality can be different from the input
 
* '''Filter''': filters act on image graylevel. They creates an output image the same size as the input. Filters are used to remove noise, filter out unwanted background or enhance feature of interest such as spots and lines.

* '''Math operations and functions''':  These category gathers usual mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction or trigonometric functions for instance. They can be used with scalars, images or image and scalar in combination. When use with images the operation are applied pixel wise.

* '''Segmentation''': Segmentation functions allow to define regions in an image. Applied to an input image they create so called label image that defines the pixel where the object lays. Each region is attributed a particular label, an integer value, that can be used to retrieve the object later. Watershed, thresholding spot and line detection can be found here. 

* '''Assess''': in that category are tools to facilitate data visualisation and measures that will be needed in every pipeline once the image processing is done.

=Installation=

If you want to use CIP in your ImageJ script simply add the CIP update site to your imageJ installation ([https://imagej.net/Following_an_update_site instruction to follow an update site]) restart imagej, open the script editor and you are good to go. If you want some inspiration you can look at one of the script of the [[CIP#Sample scripts|example section]]

To look into the source compilation and installation I invite you to look on the [https://github.com/benoalo/CIP github repository] of the project
