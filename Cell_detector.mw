== '''Introduction''' ==


This plugin automates cell detection in microscopy imagery. This is done through connection to an external classifier service which uses Random Forest based machine learning.


== '''Installation''' ==


The plugin can be downloaded from: http://sites.imagej.net/Jhowarth/

Copy the cell_detector-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar to ImageJ's plugins folder. Also copy each jar within the the jars folder to ImageJ's jars folder.  Once ImageJ is restarted the plugin will appear in the Plugin submenu as Cell Detector.

Alternatively open your ImageJ application and add http://sites.imagej.net/Jhowarth/ to the Update manger (found in the menu under Help/Update...).


== '''Usage''' ==


A user guide can be found at: http://pdfsr.com/pdf/cell-detector-guide-imagej-plugin


== '''Limitations''' ==


As this is only V1.0, if the user does not follow the required workflow then the plugin may crash and require a restart.
