[[ImageJ]] community members are often available via a couple of different chat services.

== Gitter ==

The [[wikipedia:Gitter|Gitter]] chat service, while relatively new, is a great way to discuss issues with developers of the [[SciJava]] component collection. All you need is a [https://github.com/ GitHub] account. Advantages of Gitter include a nice "21st century" web interface, email notification when participants miss messages, and a full searchable history.

== IRC ==

Some community members frequent [[wikipedia:Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] on [http://freenode.net/ irc.freenode.net], in chat rooms:

Advantages of IRC include anonymity, and maximum compatibility with a huge variety of existing chat clients.
