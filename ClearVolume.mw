== What is ClearVolume? ==
ClearVolume is a volume renderer developed at MPI-CBG. Its sources are open and can be cloned from [https://github.com/ClearVolume on GitHub]. We hope to provide our users soon with an adequate publication that can be cited in case you used ClearVolume for your research.

Channel LUTs, transparency, rendering quality, etc. can easily be set in the plugins user interface. We thank Tzumin Lee's group at Janelia for being allowed to use their twin-spot MARCM (Yu et al., Nature Neuroscience, 2009) labeled neurons.]]</center>

== Installing ClearVolume in Fiji or ImageJ2 ==

''Note:'' ClearVolume requires Fiji/ImageJ2 to run with a Java Runtime Environment >1.6. This adds additional steps to the installations instructions that will be obsolete as soon as Fiji/ImageJ2 will ship with newer versions of Java.

# Download Fiji or ImageJ2 from [http://imagej.net/Downloads here].
# Start Fiji/ImageJ2 and launch the updater ('''Help - Update...''')
# Click on '''Manage update sites''', tick the box next to '''ClearVolume''', and hit '''Close'''.
# Confirm the update/installation by clicking '''Apply changes''' and restart Fiji/ImageJ as suggested by the updater.

Depending on your operating system you will now have to ensure to run Fiji/ImageJ with a Java Runtime Environment >1.6.

; Windows
* If you do not have installed Java, do so by following [https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml these instructions]. We recommend you to install the latest version (unless you know what you are doing).
* Open '''Fiji.app''' and delete the containing folder '''java''' from it if it exists. This will prevent that Fiji/ImageJ2 launches the outdated Java version it currently ships with.

; MacOS (>OSX 10.8 only, since OpenGL 4.0 must be supported)
* If you do not have installed Java, do so by following [https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml these instructions]. We recommend you to install the latest version (unless you know what you are doing).
* Currently Fiji/ImageJ2 has to be run from a terminal window in order to use launch using a user installed Java version. Detailed instructions can be found [http://fiji.sc/Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_do_I_launch_ImageJ_with_a_different_version_of_Java.3F in this FAQ].
* A typical launch command would then look similar to this: 
*: <code>/Applications/Fiji.app/Contents/MacOS/ImageJ-macosx --java-home /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jre1.8.0_25.jdk/Contents/Home/</code>

; Linux
* If you do not have installed Java, do so by following [https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml these instructions]. We recommend you to install the latest version (unless you know what you are doing).

* A typical launch command would then look similar to this: 
*: <code>$HOME/ImageJ.app/ImageJ-linux64 --java-home /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64</code>

'''''MacOS/Linux Nerd Tip:''''' Edit the file '''.bash_profile''' (Mac) or '''.bashrc''' (Linux) located in your home folder and add an adequately modified line like:
: <code>alias fiji='/Applications/Fiji.app/Contents/MacOS/ImageJ-macosx --java-home /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_25.jdk/Contents/Home/'</code> (Mac)
: <code>alias fiji='$HOME/ImageJ.app/ImageJ-linux64 --java-home /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64'</code> (Linux)
: After restarting the terminal you can start Fiji simply by typing '''<code>fiji</code>'''.

== Other ways to use ClearVolume ==
; KNIME
: The ClearVolume team provides a plugin for KNIME Image Processing. See [http://tech.knime.org/book/clearvolume this page] for details.
; Stand-alone
: The original purpose of ClearVolume is to bring live volumetric rendering to modern microscopy. Please check the [https://github.com/clearvolume wiki on GibHub] for detailed informations.
