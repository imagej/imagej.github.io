{{ComponentStats:sc.fiji:Colour_Deconvolution}}Similarly to the command {{bc | Image | Color | RGB split}}, this plugin unmixes an RGB image produced by subtractive mixing (inks, histological dyes) into separate channels corresponding to up to 3 determined colors. This is useful e.g. to do pigment separation.
