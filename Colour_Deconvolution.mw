{{ComponentStats:sc.fiji:Colour_Deconvolution}}Similarly to the command {{bc | Image | Color | RGB split}}, this plugin unmixes an RGB image produced by subtractive mixing (inks, histological dyes) into separate channels corresponding to up to 3 determined colors. This is useful e.g. to do pigment separation.

* 07/Apr/2004 added Methyl Green DAB vectors
* 08/Jul/2004 shortened the code
* 01/Aug/2005 added fast red/blue/DAB vectors
* 02/Nov/2005 changed code to work with image stacks (DLC - dchao at fhcrc org)
