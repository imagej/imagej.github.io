== Purpose ==

This plugin allows you to merge two grayscale stacks into a single RGB stack. It is useful e.g. to merge a brightfield with the corresponding fluorescence image, or two different dye images of the same series.

== Documentation ==

Adapted from the [[MBF ImageJ]] manual:

The ''Plugins>Color functions>Color Merge'' function gives the user the option of using the '''Difference''' arithmetic processing on the image stacks you select. This is not strictly a merge (when cyan and magenta merge they produce white, not yellow) but facilitates visualization of the separate channels (See

You can perform a true merge if you turn off the “Difference” option.

Run the plugin and select the two images or stacks to be merged. It can be 8-bit, 16-bit, RGB... Select the desired colors from the drop-down options. <Current> uses the LUT that the image currently has (this is often the desired LUT). The “Difference” option performs a “difference” arithmetic operation rather than a “addition”. If the “Pre-sub 2 from 1” option is checked the second image is subtracted from the first prior to merging.
