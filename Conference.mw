== ImageJ User and Developer Conferences ==

Approximately every two years, there is a conference focused on [[ImageJ]]-based software, including both the core program itself, as well as applications and [[plugins]] thereof.

=== Future conferences ===

The [[Fiji]] and [[ImageJ2]] development teams at Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden and [[LOCI]] in UW-Madison are pleased to announce the continuation of the ImageJ conference.

* Fall 2018, Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden
* Fall 2020, University of Wisconsin, Madison

If you have any questions or if you are interested in hosting a future ImageJ conference, please start a thread on the [[ImageJ Forum]].
