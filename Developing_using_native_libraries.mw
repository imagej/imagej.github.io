= Introduction =

Sometimes, you may want to use 3rd party libraries that are not available as Java components, but only as native libraries.

There are two options available to make use of native libraries: [http://jna.java.net/ JNA] and JNI (see below for detailed descriptions).

== Disadvantages of using native libraries ==

Even if JNA and JNI provide some convenience for using native libraries, there are substantial downsides of using native libraries:

* Using native libraries flies in the face of the platform independence of Java
: Even if Fiji only supports 32-bit/64-bit Windows, MacOSX and Linux (and PowerPC with MacOSX for the time being), it is a major hassle to maintain them. It also means that you incur the problems with C/C++ where a library compiling successfully on one platform does not at all imply that it compiles on any other platform. There are even examples of C code compiling fine for 32-bit but not for 64-bit CPUs on the very same Operating system.

* No "Compile once, run everywhere"
: It is one of Java's greatest strengths that you do not need to compile for every platform you plan (or anyone else plans) to run on. Native libraries take away that advantage.

* By using native libraries, it is much easier to produce fatal errors that tear down the complete Java virtual machine. Consequently, debugging can be really hard when using native libraries.

For further arguments to use Java instead of native libraries, see also our [[Why Java|rationale for using Java]].

== JNA vs JNI ==

The benefits of JNA over JNI are:

* scriptable
* you do not need a C compiler
* a native library can be dropped in for an additional platform without any recompilation

The benefits of JNI over JNA are:

* official part of Java
* way faster
* JNI is "type-safer" (i.e. Java and native code access data via the same type definitions)

= JNA =

The [http://jna.java.net/ JNA project] (''Java Native Access'') tries to provide an easy, pure-Java way to access native libraries using their native interface.

== Functions ==

To this end, the developer has to define an interface describing in Java terms what functions the library provides. Example:

<source lang="java">
import com.sun.jna.Library;

public interface C extends Library {
        public int symlink(String oldpath, String newpath);
}
</source>

Note:
* Even if the package name is ''com.sun.jna'', JNA is not an official part of Java. As a consequence, JNA supports less platforms than official Java itself.
* You do not need to declare all the functions offered by the native library. In this example, only ''symlink'' was declared.
* The Java type ''String'' is mapped to ''const char *'' in the C layer. The same happens for other primitive Java types.
* Since the parameters need to be mapped prior to calling the native function, and mapped back after it returns, and all this mapping is done using reflection, JNA is relatively slow compared to JNI (except when the amount of time spent copying data is outweighed by the processing time spent within the native library).
* There is no guarantee by the compiler that the interface is correct. In fact, you can declare the functions incorrectly very easily, which results in hard crashes of the Java virtual machine.

Use the library in this way:

<source lang="java">
C c = (C)NativeLibrary.loadLibrary("c", C.class);
int result = c.symlink(source, target);
</source>

=== Specifying library search paths ===

If you want to use a library that is not installed in one of the locations your platform looks for libraries by default, you may need to tell JNA where to find the library:

<source lang="java">
NativeLibrary.addSearchPath("opencv", "C:\\opencv");
OpenCV openCV = (OpenCV)NativeLibrary.loadLibrary("opencv", OpenCV.class);
</source>

Note: some libraries depend on other libraries. If the dependencies are not in the default library path, it might be not possible to load them from within Java without restarting the virtual machine, depending on the platform. On Linux, e.g. you would need to set the environment variable ''LD_LIBRARY_PATH'' accordingly (setting them in the Java process does not help, as the dynamic loader was already initialized and does not respect a change in that variable after initialization).

=== Constants/enums ===

If the C header defines constants using the ''#define'' statement, the constant is nowhere to be found in the compiled native library. Likewise, the C compiler optimizes out the names of enums. Therefore, both constants and enums need to be defined in the interface.

For example, this C header:

<source lang="C">
#ifndef MY_HEADER_H
#define MY_HEADER_H

#define OFF 0
#define ON 0xff

enum counter_t {
        ZERO,
        ONE,
        TWO,
        THREE
};

extern counter_t get_counter(void);
#endif
</source>

would need to be handled with a JNA-based interface like this one:

<source lang="java">
public interface MyLibrary extends Library {
        public final int OFF = 0;
        public final int ON = 0xff;
        public final int ZERO = 0;
        public final int ONE = 1;
        public final int TWO = 2;
        public final int THREE = 3;

        public int get_counter();
}
</source>

=== Structures ===

Some functions do not take simple data types as parameters, but so-called ''structs''. These have to be defined as inner static classes of the interface, and they need to extend the class ''com.sun.jna.Structure'':

<source lang="java">
import com.sun.jna.Library;
import com.sun.jna.Structure;

public interface C extends Library {
        public static class timeval implements Structure {
                long tv_sec, tv_usec;
        }
        public static class timezeone implements Structure {
                int tz_minuteswest, tz_dsttime;
        }
        public int gettimeofday(timeval timeval, timezone timezone);
}
</source>

Some fields of the structures might be fixed-size arrays (e.g. ''unsigned char path[1024]''). These fields should be declared with default initializers in Java (e.g. ''byte[] path = new byte[1024];'').

==== Accessing structures via pointers ====

A function you call may return a pointer to a structure. To initialize the fields of a Java version of such a structure, you can use the ''useMemory(Pointer)'' and ''read()'' methods:

<source lang="java">
...
        public static class MyStruct {
                public MyStruct(Pointer p) {
                        // cannot use super(p) because of fixed-size array fields
                        super();
                        useMemory(p); // set pointer
                        read(); // initialize fields
                }

                public MyStruct() {
                        super();
                        // handle fixed-size array fields correctly
                        ensureAllocated();
                }
        }
...
</source>

Note: when the superclass' constructor is called, the fixed-size array fields are not yet initialized. Therefore, the superclass' constructor has no way to handle them correctly: their size is not known. That is the reason why you have to call ''ensureAllocated()'' and why you cannot use the superclass' ''super(Pointer)'' constructor. Technically, when your struct does not contain fixed-size array fields, you can, but getting used to always avoid the ''super(Pointer)'' constructor will help you stay out of trouble.

=== Passing structures by value ===

When passing instances of a Structure to a function, memory is allocated and written to automatically, and a pointer is passed.

If you want to pass a Structure by value instead, you have to subclass it and implement the ''Structure.ByValue'' interface. This interface is purely a tag, and does not require any additional functions to be defined.

Example:

<source lang="java">
public class Timespec extends Structure {
	long tv_sec;
	long tv_usec;
}

public class Stat extends Structure {
	long /* dev_t */      st_dev;     /* ID of device containing file */
	long /* ino_t */      st_ino;     /* inode number */
	long /* nlink_t */    st_nlink;   /* number of hard links */
	int /* mode_t */      st_mode;    /* protection */
	int /* uid_t */       st_uid;     /* user ID of owner */
	int /* gid_t */       st_gid;     /* group ID of owner */
	int __pad0;
	long /* dev_t */      st_rdev;    /* device ID (if special file) */
	long /* off_t */      st_size;    /* total size, in bytes */
	long /* blksize_t */  st_blksize; /* blocksize for file system I/O */
	int /* blkcnt_t */    st_blocks;  /* number of 512B blocks allocated */
	Timespec /* time_t */ st_atime;   /* time of last access */
	Timespec /* time_t */ st_mtime;   /* time of last modification */
	Timespec /* time_t */ st_ctime;   /* time of last status change */
}

public class StatByValue extends Stat implements Structure.ByValue {
	public StatByValue(Stat stat) {
		super();
		ensureAllocated();
		byte[] buffer = new byte[size()];
		stat.getPointer().read(0, buffer, 0, buffer.length);
		getPointer().write(0, buffer, 0, buffer.length);
		read();
	}
}
</source>

== Scripting JNA ==

In [[Beanshell Scripting|Beanshell]], it is not possible to extend interfaces, so it is not possible to imitate the plain Java way to use JNA. Other scripting languages have similar problems as far as JNA is concerned.

But you can use the ''getFunction(String)'' method of ''NativeLibrary'' to get a function object, whose methods ''invokeInt(Object[])'', ''invokePointer(Object[])'' and friends will allow you to call the function.

If the result is not a basic type, you can use ''Pointer'''s methods to access the data. Beanshell example:

<source lang="java">
import com.sun.jna.NativeLibrary;

// get the C runtime library
c = NativeLibrary.getInstance("c");

// retrieve the getenv() function and call it
getenv = c.getFunction("getenv");
print(getenv.invokePointer(new Object[] { "HELLO" }).getString(0));

// retrieve and use the setenv() function
setenv = c.getFunction("setenv");
print(setenv.invokeInt(new Object[] { "HELLO", "world", new Integer(1) }));

// show that it did something
print(getenv.invokePointer(new Object[] { "HELLO" }).getString(0));

// note that System.getenv() remains oblivious
print(System.getenv("HELLO"));
</source>

There can be substantial complications: some function names do not actually refer to functions in the native library, but are redirected to another function by the preprocessor. Example: at least on Linux, ''lstat()'' actually calls ''__lxstat()'' with additional parameters.

Also, the classes defined in your scripting language of choice might not be applicable for use with JNA. Beanshell, for one, adds two fields that JNA cannot (and should not) handle. As a workaround, you can use ''Pointer'''s ''get'' family of methods.

Example:

<source lang="java">
import com.sun.jna.Memory;
import com.sun.jna.NativeLibrary;

import java.util.Date;

c = NativeLibrary.getInstance("c");
lstat = c.getFunction("__lxstat");
errno = c.getFunction("errno");

path = System.getProperty("fiji.dir");
print(path);
stat = new Memory(144);
result = lstat.invokeInt(new Object[] { new Integer(0), path, stat });

print("result: " + result);
if (result < 0) {
	strerror = c.getFunction("strerror");
	err = errno.getInt(0);
	error = strerror.invokePointer(new Object[] { new Integer(err) }).getString(0);
	print("errno: " + error + " (" + err + ")");
}
print("blocks: " + stat.getInt(64));
print("atime: " + new Date(stat.getLong(72) * 1000));
print("mtime: " + new Date(stat.getLong(88) * 1000));
print("ctime: " + new Date(stat.getLong(104) * 1000));
</source>
