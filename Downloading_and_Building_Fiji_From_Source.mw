{{FijiMenu}}The complete Fiji distribution of ImageJ consists of over a hundred individual components. Most of these components are ImageJ [[plugins]]; the rest are core libraries, [[scripts]] and several other resources (such as the [[:File:Fiji-icon.png|Fiji logo]] and the README).

In the past, Fiji used to be built from one monolithic source code repository, which became unmanageable over the time. These days, therefore, developers start from a fully-populated ''Fiji.app/'' directory and build only the parts they would like to change.

= Download Fiji =

The first step is the same for developers as it is for users: [[Downloads|Download]] Fiji, and unpack it. The Desktop is the recommended location.

= Check out and build individual plugins/libraries =

To develop a plugin, the developer first needs to find out in which file it is contained. To do that, simply call the ''Command Finder'' (shortcut {{key press|Ctrl|L}}), type (part of) the label of the menu entry in whose function you are interested, and look at the ''File'' column.

Each individual component is maintained in its own repository in the [https://github.com/fiji/ ''fiji'' org on GitHub]. The name of the repository corresponding to a given ''.jar'' file is essentially identical with the file name, except that trailing underscores are stripped. Example: ''Stitching_.jar'' is maintained in the repository at https://github.com/fiji/Stitching, ''Time_Lapse.jar'' in the repository at https://github.com/fiji/Time_Lapse.

If in doubt about the location of the repository, just call {{bc | Plugins | Debug | System Information}} and find the section corresponding to the file in question.

Once the developer has identified which plugin or library she wants to modify or develop further, it is very easy to build and contribute by following [[How to contribute to an existing plugin or library|this tutorial]].

== Example ==

Let's assume that we want to develop the Skeletonize3D plugin. Its source code is maintained at https://github.com/fiji/Skeletonize3D. The first step is to clone the source code:

<source lang="bash">
$ git clone https://github.com/fiji/Skeletonize3D
Cloning into 'Skeletonize3D'...
remote: Counting objects: 115, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (58/58), done.
remote: Total 115 (delta 46), reused 115 (delta 46)
Receiving objects: 100% (115/115), 22.81 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (46/46), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
</source>

You only need to type the part after the ''$'' prompt, i.e you would type <code>git clone https://github.com/fiji/Skeletonize3D</code>. The rest is shown only for reference, so that you know what to expect.

Then let's use the command-line Maven to build the project:

<source lang="bash">
$ cd Skeletonize3D/
$ mvn
[INFO] Scanning for projects...
[... lots and lots of interesting and useful information ...]
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time: 52.574s
[INFO] Finished at: Tue Dec 02 10:27:00 CET 2014
[INFO] Final Memory: 20M/81M
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</source>

And finally, let's build the project and install it into the ''Fiji.app/'' directory:

<source lang="bash">
$ mvn -Dimagej.app.directory=$HOME/Desktop/Fiji.app/ -Ddelete.other.versions=true
[INFO] Scanning for projects...
[... lots and lots of interesting and useful information ...]
[INFO]
[INFO] --- imagej-maven-plugin:0.5.4:copy-jars (copy-jars) @ Skeletonize3D_ ---

[INFO] Finished at: Tue Dec 02 10:30:02 CET 2014
[INFO] Final Memory: 14M/81M
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</source>

Of course, this assumes that you followed the suggestion and unpacked your Fiji onto the Desktop. If you unpacked it somewhere else, you ''have'' to adjust the command-line accordingly.

Note that the exact dependency versions, as specified by the project in the ''pom.xml'' file, are copied into the ''Fiji.app/'' directory, possibly replacing other versions. You will want to make sure to use not-too-different versions from the current versions.
