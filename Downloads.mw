Please bear in mind: Fiji is ''beta'' software for now.  If you want it to become stable, please consider submitting [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/bugzilla/ bug reports], or ask for help on [http://groups.google.com/group/fiji-users the mailing list], but be prepared to test our fixes, too :-)

<b>Please note! The authoritative site for Fiji is <i>http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de</i>, so if you downloaded Fiji from some mirrors such as Softpedia and experience problems, please re-download from here and verify that the problem still exists.</b>

=== Packages for Debian / Ubuntu ===

'''These packages have not been extensively tested, so feedback to mark-fiji ''at'' longair.net would be very much appreciated.'''

There are Debian packages of Fiji.  Add the following lines to /etc/apt/sources.list:

 <nowiki>deb http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/downloads/apt/ ./</nowiki>
 <nowiki>deb-src http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/downloads/apt/ ./</nowiki>

Then do the following:

 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install fiji

You should then be able to just run "fiji" from the command line.

Alternatively, if you want to install the .deb files directly with dpkg, you can download the packages directly here:

* [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/downloads/apt/binary-i386/fiji_20090513_i386.deb Package for i386 (32 bit)]
* [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/downloads/apt/binary-amd64/fiji_20090513_amd64.deb Package for amd64 (64 bit)]

==== Known Bugs ====

* These packages should work for you, but fail to meet policy for being official Debian and Ubuntu packages in many ways - we are working towards this, however, so if you use the apt repository above and update regularly, you should see the packages improve and reduce in size over time.

* These packages aren't signed at the moment, so you will get a warning about the packages not being authenticated.
