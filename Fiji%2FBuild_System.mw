== Introduction ==

The goal of Fiji's build system is to make it extremely simple to define the tasks that are needed for Fiji.

The system finds its ''targets'' in a file called ''Fakefile'' (''Fiji's mAKE FILE'').  The contents of that file look like this:

 all <- example.jar another-example.jar
 
 example.jar <- example/**/*.java README LICENSE
 
 another-example.jar <- SomeClass.java

This file defines three targets: the default target called 'all', and two targets building .jar files.  The operation is defined implicitly by the name of the target.

== Nomenclature ==

The ''Fakefile'' contains ''rules'' for ''targets'' that are defined in the following form:

 target <- prerequisites

If a prerequisite is also the target of another rule, the program builds that target before building the current one.

== Calling Fiji's build system ==

If you have a working Fiji launcher, you can call the build system like this:

 ./fiji --build

If your Fiji launcher does not work, or you do not have one yet, bootstrap it like this:

 ./Build.sh fiji

You can ask the program to build only specific targets by passing them as parameters:

 ./fiji --build ij.jar

Further, all variable definitions passed as parameters will override what is found in the Fakefile:

 ./fiji --build debug=true fake.jar

== Target types ==

The following target types are available:

;The ''all'' target:
:The first target in the ''Fakefile'' is always the default target. It lists all subtargets that are to be made by default.

;''.jar'' targets:
:If the target name ends with ''.jar'', a .jar is made.  If the last prerequisite also ends in ''.jar'', the build system will copy that file instead of trying to compile ''.java'' files.

:The system is actually quite clever when it comes to putting the compiled classes into the ''.jar'' files; it figures out in which package the class lives, and uses the corresponding path.

;''.class'' targets:
:Targets whose name end in ''.class'' compile a single ''.java'' file (the last prerequisite is used to define that), and copies the resulting ''.class'' file (and the other generated classes that are used by this class) to the given destination.

;''.cxx'' and ''.c'' targets:
:If the last prerequisite ends in ''.cxx'' or ''.c'', the GNU C compiler is called to compile the prerequisites.

;"SubBuild" targets:
:If the last prerequisite specifies a directory, the build system looks for a ''Fakefile'' or a ''Makefile'' there.  According to what was found, Fiji's build system or ''make'' is called, and the target is copied over to the given destination.

;Special targets:
:Some targets are predefined, but can be overridden in the ''Fakefile''.  These include ''clean'', ''show-vars'' and others.

== Special targets ==

;clean
:Remove all generated targets.  This target is not well tested.  '''Use with care'''.

;show-vars
:Show all defined variables

;show-rules
:Show all rules (with expanded variables)
 
;check
:Instead of building the targets, this target just shows which targets are not up to date and would be built.

== Variables ==

You can define variables in the usual way:

 ONE=1

This can be done either in the Fakefile or on the command line, as in this example:

 ./fiji --build debug=true

Variables can be referenced in all parts of a rule.  Variables can be overridden per-target:

 ONE(ij.jar)=2
 ij.jar <- bla$ONE.java

This is especially useful if you need to set a plugin specific CLASSPATH:

 CLASSPATH(plugins/my_plugin.jar)=plugins/some_other_plugin.jar


=== Predefined variables ===

TODO, for the moment there's just a list here with known variables:

* debug (default: debug=false)
* showdeprecation (default: showdeprecation=false, switches the java compiler options "-deprecation" and "-Xlint:unchecked" on)
* verbose (default: verbose=false)

== Other features ==

=== Precompiled targets ===

TODO

=== Default targets ===

TODO (like '''plugins/*.jar <- src-plugins/*/**/*''')
