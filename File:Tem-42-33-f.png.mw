==MOPS feature correspondences (example 1)==

Two TEM images from consecutive sections of the Drosophila first instar larval brain data set by Albert Cardona.  Both sections are approximately related by a 2d-rigid transformation separated by 60nm section thickness.  Automatically extracted landmark correspondences using the MOPS descriptor are overlaid.  One example and its respective descriptors are shown.  The upper left corner of the descriptor patch is marked with an arrow.  See also [[:Image:Lab-404-403-f.png|example 2]].
