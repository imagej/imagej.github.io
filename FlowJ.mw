{{ComponentStats:sc.fiji:FlowJ_}}FlowJ is a plugin that implements the main gradient-based optical flow techniques, such as Lucas and Kanade, Uras, Fleet and Jepson and Singh algorithms. 

== Documentation ==

Please refer to the author [http://bij.isi.uu.nl/flowj.htm webpage] for all information on how to use this plugin, as well as references.


== ChangeLog ==

Since FlowJ is maintained inside Fiji, the following changes have been made:

* When you compute all flow fields and then display them, the "Display static background" box is now properly handled (noticed by Christina Eugster).
* There is a "Display magnitude" button now to get the magnitudes of the flow vectors (i.e. the local "speed" in pixels per frame).
