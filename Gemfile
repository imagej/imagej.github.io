# NB: This site uses stock GitHub Pages deployment, as described at:
#
#    https://pages.github.com/versions/
#
# However, builds with Jekyll 4.2 are orders of magnitude faster than with
# Jekyll 3.9, especially on Windows (6x faster) and macOS (3x faster).
#
# Therefore, this Gemfile declares Jekyll 4.2 with a suitable config,
# rather than using the github-pages gem, so that local builds will
# benefit from the superior performance.
#
# When developing functionality for the site, please take care to
# use only features available in Jekyll 3.9 / stock GitHub Pages.
