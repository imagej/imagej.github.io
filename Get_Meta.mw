== '''Overview''' ==

This plugin extracts the metadata from DM3 files and saves the information in a text file, which can be useful for importing that info into a database. 

== '''How it works''' ==

It asks you to choose the directory in which the images are saved, and then it loops through the list of images extracting and saving the image info to text files.

== '''Image Requirements''' ==

It will only operate on the files with the .DM3 extension in the directory. So you can have other files in there that won't be operated on by the plugin.
