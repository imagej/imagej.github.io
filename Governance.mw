{{Development}}
The [[ImageJ]] project, and related projects in the [[SciJava]] software ecosystem, are governed as [[Open Source]] software projects.  Everybody is welcome to [[contribute]] with [[plugins]], patches, [[Bugs|bug reports]], [[tutorials]], [[documentation]], and artwork.

That said, every project needs leaders: the ones who participate in ''governance'' of the project, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_maintenance maintaining] the software and making key decisions.

== Project roles ==

Because [[open source]] software is highly collaborative, it is extremely important to understand the difference between various roles on the project, to avoid misconceptions about '''authority''' (who makes decisions) and '''responsibility''' (who must do the work) concerning each project.

The most common roles are:

* '''Founders''' are the people who originally launched the project.
* '''Leads''' are responsible for making final decisions. In the [[open source]] world these people are often referred to as [http://catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/homesteading/ar01s16.html benevolent dictators]. Changes with a serious impact on the community are typically [[Mailing Lists|discussed on open channels]] first.
* '''Maintainers''' keep the project functional, fix bugs and make releases. They often make day to day decisions, and are typically involved in discussion with the project lead(s) regarding major decisions, although the lead has final decision-making authority.
* '''Developers''' are people who work on the project significantly or often. Typically they have direct push access to the source code. In some cases they make day to day decisions, depending on their experience and comfort level with the project.
* '''Contributors''' are people who help with the project either currently or in the past. They may participate occasionally or sporadically, and are typically not involved in project decision making.

=== Levels of maintenance and development ===

Each project in the ecosystem has a distinct development path, with varying levels of maturity and activity. These paths are ultimately determined by the people who participate in developing the project. The following table conveys the levels of commitment pledged by people with various project roles:

<sup>1</sup> Pietzsch leads on day to day issues. Pietzsch, Preibisch and Saalfeld vote on primary decisions, with Pietzsch's vote breaking ties.
<br><sup>2</sup> Schindelin is currently on sabbatical from Fiji; see [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/fiji-devel/coIgXLws0eI/TZlwjXLyks0J this thread on fiji-devel].
<br><sup>3</sup> Barber leads development of the {{GitHub | org=slim-curve | repo=slim-curve | label=SLIM Curve C library}}; Rueden leads development of the {{GitHub | org=slim-curve | repo=slim-plugin | label=SLIM Curve plugin for ImageJ}}.
<br><sup>4</sup> Rueden maintains the Bio-Formats [[update site]] for ImageJ, but is not otherwise a Bio-Formats maintainer.
<br><sup>5</sup> For the purposes of this table, "KNIME" means the [[KNIME|KNIME Image Processing]] extensions, not the KNIME project as a whole.
