}}ImageJ 1.x, often shortened to ImageJ1 or IJ1, is a stable version of [[ImageJ]] which has been under continuous development since 1997. It has always been, and continues to be, a one-developer project of {{Person|Rasband}}.

ImageJ was originally developed in 1997 as a cross-platform version of [[NIH Image]]. ImageJ grew organically over time as {{Person|Rasband}} continued to add features according to user requests. Now there are many hundreds, probably thousands, of plugins written by members of a diverse community.

The current version of ImageJ is often referred to as [[ImageJ2]], to differentiate it from ImageJ 1.x. The ImageJ2 distribution actually includes the latest version of ImageJ1 as well, along with a [[ImageJ Legacy|legacy layer]] for backwards compatibility, which transparently converts between IJ1 and IJ2 data structures as needed.
