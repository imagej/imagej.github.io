== '''Overview''' ==
This tool measures and marks the size of features. It annotates the length of line tool in a calibrated image and export measurement results. The macro was modified based on an annotation tool made by Nick to accommodate different image type (bit depth and color channel). 

== '''How to use''' ==

1. Once image is calibrated. Use “Straight line” tool to drag a line across a feature and click “Image Annotation”. The length of line will be annotated on the image.
