The extraction wizard will ask you for a destination on the second page; you should not use the default (which is a temporary directory), but select something like ''Desktop'' instead:

At the end, the extraction wizard will ask you if it should open the directory which contains the extracted files.  Say yes, and open the extracted directory ''Fiji.app'':

You can start [[Main_Page|Fiji]] by double-clicking on the ''fiji-win32'' executable (on 64-bit systems, it is ''fiji-win64'').

Next time you want to start Fiji, just open the ''Fiji.app'' directory on your desktop and double-click on the executable.  To make things easier, you might want to create a shortcut to that executable and put it on the Desktop, into the Start menu, or into the QuickLaunch bar.
