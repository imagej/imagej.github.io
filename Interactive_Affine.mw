This plugin allows to apply a '''free affine transformation''' to a 2D image in an interactive way.

'''Premises''': You need an image to be open.

'''Use''': 
# When calling the plugin, '''three points''' (represented as yellow PointRois) will be displayed on the image. 
# Drag and drop the points to interactively transform the image with an '''affine model'''.
# If you are satisfied with the result, press ENTER, otherwise, press ESC.
