{{DevelopMenu | tools}}{{Minibox | logo=Jenkins.png | blurb='''Jenkins:''' Serving the ImageJ community since 2010!}}ImageJ has a [http://jenkins.imagej.net/ Jenkins server]: a continuous integration system which automatically checks the code for build and test errors.

Jenkins tests builds and performs [[releases]] for [[SciJava]] projects. It deploys <code>SNAPSHOT</code> builds to the [http://maven.imagej.net/ ImageJ Maven repository] in response to pushes to each code repository's <code>master</code> branch. So any downstream projects depending on a version of <code>LATEST</code> for a given component will match the last successful Jenkins build—i.e., the latest code on <code>master</code>.

Because every build also runs the associated [[wikipedia:Unit testing|unit tests]], Jenkins is instrumental in early detection of new bugs introduced to the codebase.

You can access Jenkins's last successful build artifacts from the [[Downloads]] page.

Jenkins also performs [[releases]], including [http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/Synchronize-and-deploy-IJ1/ automatically deploying ImageJ 1.x] and [http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/ImageJ1-releases/ building installers for ImageJ 1.x].

Jenkins performs many other services too, such as keeping Git repository mirrors in sync, building javadocs and updating other web resources.

== Travis CI ==

Developers of third party libraries and plugins can look at [[Travis]] for an open-source CI tool, with build configurations stored in the source repository itself.

== Emotional Jenkins ==

Jenkins is ImageJ's robot butler! He does his job faithfully, and without rest.

When things are going well, he is happy. But when code breaks, he can become sad, or even angry:

Make sure you keep your code shipshape if you want to avoid the butler's wrath!
