}}[http://knime.org/ KNIME], the '''K'''o'''n'''stanz '''I'''nformation '''M'''in'''e'''r, is an open source data analytics, reporting and integration platform. KNIME integrates various components for machine learning and data mining through its modular data pipelining concept. A graphical user interface allows assembly of nodes for data preprocessing (ETL: Extraction, Transformation, Loading), for modeling and data analysis and visualization.

The [http://tech.knime.org/community/image-processing '''KN'''IME '''I'''mage '''P'''rocessing], extension, KNIP, provides ca. 100 nodes for (pre)-processing, filtering, segmentation, feature extraction, various views (2D, 3D), etc. and integrations for various other image processing tools are available.

As part of the KNIP extension, there is an [http://tech.knime.org/community/imagej ImageJ extension for KNIME] consisting of two basic parts: the support for [[ImageJ1]] macro execution and the integration of [[ImageJ2]] plugins as KNIME nodes. Both approaches are available as KNIME plugin (currently beta status).
