== Presentation ==

''KymographBuilder is Yet Another Kymograph Fiji plugin.''

Features are :

* Build kymograph from a straight or segmented line (a polyline).
* Build kymograph for images with multiple channels.
* Take into account the width of the line using maximum projection along its thickness.
* Built from scratch and use the ImageJ2 Ecosystem.
* Fast and easy to use.

How to use :
* Draw a line: it can be a polyline and you can also set the thickness that will be taken into account by the plugin.
* Launch KymographBuilder : {{bc|Plugins|Kymograph|KymographBuilder}}
* You're done.
