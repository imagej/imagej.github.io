The plugin '''Landmark Correspondences''' calculates a transformation between two corresponding landmark clouds and renders a transformed image.  The landmarks are read from point selections over two images.  The transformation is estimated by a least squares or Moving Least Squares fit for the available models.

The non-linear non-invertible transformations as estimated using the Moving Least Squares method are rendered through a mesh of triangles whose resolution is a parameter of the plugin, see [[Interactive Moving Least Squares]] for an intuitive explanation.
