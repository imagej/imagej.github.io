The ImageJ launcher is a native application for launching ImageJ.

== Introduction ==

The launcher supports the following flavors of ImageJ:

* [[ImageJ1]]
* [[ImageJ2]]
* [[Fiji]]

The launcher is a native executable whose purpose is to start up a Java Virtual Machine and run ImageJ 1.x, Fiji or ImageJ2 in it. It is used in the [http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/ImageJ1-releases/ ImageJ 1.x releases], the [[Fiji]] distribution as well as in [[ImageJ2]]. It is built by ImageJ2's [http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/ImageJ-launcher/ Jenkins server] (i.e. the server that builds and tests all ImageJ and Fiji source code continuously).

== Source ==

The ImageJ launcher source code lives on {{GitHub|org=imagej|repo=imagej-launcher|label=GitHub}}.

== Purpose ==

The launcher provides a platform-specific entry point into the ImageJ Java application. Its most major function is to facilitate the ImageJ Updater feature by taking care of pending updates when ImageJ is first launched.

== Usage ==

For an overview of supported options, run:

 ./ImageJ-xyz --help

where xyz is your platform.

The launcher can do all kinds of things, like:

* Launch ImageJ with a different amount of memory (<code>--mem</code> option)
* Run [[Headless|macros and scripts in headless mode]]
* Control the [[Updater]] from the command line

== Download ==

The launcher comes with ImageJ1, ImageJ2 and Fiji.

But up-to-date versions can always be [http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/ImageJ-launcher/ downloaded from Jenkins] if you like.
