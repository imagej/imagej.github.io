== LinearDistance ==

Plugin for ImageJ to measure linear distances in binary images in X and Y direction.
It scans an image linewise (with a given skip distance) in both directions and finds stripes of only black or white and calculates the mean length of these stripes. 


== Application ==

Used for the calcuation of mean free paths in a two phase material.


== Dependecies ==
tested with ImageJ 1.50e and Fiji


== Installation ==

Copy the File '''LinearDistance_.jar''' in the plugins/jars folder. 
When using Fiji, you can simply add the update site '''LinearDistance'''.


== Usage ==

Open one or more binary (black/white) images or binarize an image. Start the plugin by selecting "Plugins>Analyze>Measure linear distances" and select the results you want to obtain.


== Available Options ==

! Description
|-
| Apply image calibration        
| Applies the set scale of each image to the results (by multiplying it)
|-
| Step distance between measures 
| The number of pixels/units to skip between the analyzed lines
|-
| Calibrate step distance        
| Skip units instead of pixels
|-
| Measure all opened images      
| When not selected, only the active image will be analyzed
|-
| Standard Deviations            
| Print standard deviations for all measurements
|-
| Numbers                        
| Print the number of counted stripes
|-
| Both Phases                    
| Calculates also the mean of both (all) Phases (Black and White)
