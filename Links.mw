== Image Processing and Ethics ==

It becomes more and more important to have clear-cut guidelines what types of image processing are appropriate and what processing is questionable at best.

[http://www.uab.edu/researchintegrityandimages/guidelines/list.html Here] is a comprehensive list of 12 rules you need to follow if you want to perform science rather than art.

== Input/Output ==

=== Movie support ===

There is a beta-quality Movie support for all of Fiji's supported platforms available via the update site ''http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/~schindelin/ffmpeg-plugins/'' (see [[How_to_follow_a_3rd_party_update_site|these instructions]] on how to follow an update site).

Bio-Formats has started [http://www.loci.wisc.edu/bio-formats-format/quicktime-movie supporting] parts of the Quicktime specification without relying on the native Quicktime4Java that is not even supported on 64-bit MacOSX, let alone Linux.

== Image Processing ==

[http://alvyray.com/Memos/6_pixel.pdf A pixel is not a little square]. Really. It is not. Pixels may be spaced on a regular grid. But that does not make them square. Even thinking about them as squares will harm your analysis, since it is simply wrong.

Explore the [http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/ Hypermedia Image Processing Reference] of the Department of Artificial Intelligence in the University of Edinburgh for an extensive overview of available image processing techniques.

The University of Edinburgh also has the rather complete [http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CVonline/ CVonline] compendium of Computer Vision.

== Programming in science ==

In research Software should be treated just like materials: if you publish your results, you should [http://sciencecodemanifesto.org/ publish the software (including source code)], too.

Even [http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101013/full/467753a.html Nature] says that your code is good enough; you should publish it if you want to be a good scientist.

If you're still unsure and think that your code is not good enough, then publish it under a license [http://matt.might.net/articles/crapl/ appropriate for science].
