== Tutorials provided by microscopy facilities ==

It is an oft-unrecognized fact that the most valuable resources for science are provided by facilities which, driven by pure enthusiasm in lieu of proper funding, collect, retain and maintain knowledge that would otherwise be lost. Here is a list of links to facilities providing tutorials and documentation:

* [http://www.unige.ch/medecine/bioimaging/tricks/imagejtutorials.html University of Geneva]
* [http://www.biodip.de/wiki/Teaching_Material BioDIP (formerly known as ''Imaging Facilities Network'') teaching materials]
* [http://cmci.embl.de/mainpages/documents Centre for Molecular and Cellular Imaging at the EMBL]

== Tutorials by microscope vendors ==

[http://www.kairosinstruments.com/ Karios Instruments] has a number of [http://www.kairosinstruments.com/?page_id=330 interesting Fiji tutorials] (the same page shows tutorials on using [http://www.cellprofiler.org CellProfiler], too).

== [[3D Viewer]] ==

Tutorials how to use the 3D Viewer, and how to develop new code using the 3D Viewer's API can be found on the [http://3dviewer.neurofly.de/ 3D Viewer's home page].

== [[Simple Neurite Tracer]] ==

The [http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s9808248/imagej/tracer/ home page of the Simple Neurite Tracer] has a bunch of screencasts demonstrating how to use it.

== [[TrakEM2]] ==

We have a [[TrakEM2_tutorials|list of external TrakEM2 tutorials]], and the [http://t2.ini.uzh.ch/trakem2.html TrakEM2 home page bears even more].
