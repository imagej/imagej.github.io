{{Development | source}}= What does the pom version mean? =

The {{GitHub|org=imagej|repo=minimal-ij1-plugin|path=pom.xml|label=pom.xml}} of [https://github.com/imagej/minimal-ij1-plugin/ minimal-ij1-plugin] inherits from a parent called
{{GitHub|org=scijava|repo=scijava-common|path=pom-scijava/pom.xml|label=pom-scijava}}. This parent POM defines and configures many things so that the
POMs of individual plugin projects are shorter (i.e., so they don't have to
repeat things).

The version of pom-scijava (1.27 as of this writing) indicates the version
of that parent POM. We occasionally improve the parent POM, adding and
tweaking it. When we do so, its version increases. I suggest leaving the
version that same as what's in minimal-ij1-plugin, since that refers to the
latest version. Future 1.x versions will be backwards compatible, so if you
later notice that we have updated minimal-ij1-plugin to e.g. 1.43, you can
(optionally) update your plugin to that version as well.

The version of minimal-ij1-plugin itself (1.0.0 as of this writing) is the
version of your plugin. This string is appended to the JAR file name (e.g.,
minimal-ij1-plugin-1.0.0.jar), so that you can differentiate between
multiple versions of your plugin. Use whatever versioning scheme you want.

However, once you become more comfortable with Maven, I suggest using [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5901378/what-exactly-is-a-maven-snapshot-and-why-do-we-need-it a SNAPSHOT version during development], and a release (i.e., non-SNAPSHOT) version when distributing your plugin. The reason is to avoid two different JAR files both called ''my-plugin-1.2.3'' but with different contents. (This is part of what Maven calls *build reproducibility*.)

For example, while you develop your plugin, you might use the version ''1.0.0-SNAPSHOT'' to indicate that this is not the final ''1.0.0'' version but leads up to it. Once you are happy with the plugin in its current form, switch to ''1.0.0''. Note, however, that Maven will not like it too much if you change the sources of the final ''1.0.0'' version without advancing the version in the ''pom.xml'' file.

= How is the imagej version determined? =

In many ''pom.xml'' files, you can see that the version of the ''ij'' dependency is declared like this:

<source lang="xml">
<version>${imagej1.version}</version>
</source>

The string ''${imagej1.version}'' is a property that gets replaced with the actual value. This value is {{GitHub|org=scijava|repo=scijava-common|tag=5c1764b9|path=pom-scijava/pom.xml#L21|label=defined in the pom-scijava parent configuration}}. Currently the value is ''[1.45s,)'' which means ''the latest release version you can find equal to or greater than 1.45s.''

Browse the latest pom-scijava {{GitHub|org=scijava|repo=scijava-common|path=pom-scijava/pom.xml|label=here}}.

Browse the available versions of ImageJ 1.x [http://maven.imagej.net/content/repositories/releases/net/imagej/ij/ here].

As of this writing, 1.47n is the latest available version, so that's the one Maven will use with your plugin.

If you require an ImageJ 1.x version newer than 1.45s (e.g. due to the use of a method or class that was only introduced in a later version) you probably want to override the setting in your ''pom.xml'' file's ''<properties>'' section:

<source lang="xml">
<properties>
  ...
  <imagej1.version>[1.47b,)</imagej1.version>
  ...
</properties>
</source>

= What's this: ''Property 'imagej.app.directory' unset; Skipping copy-jars'' =

This is part of the {{GitHub|org=imagej|repo=imagej-maven-plugin|label=imagej-maven-plugin}} (enabled for you by pom-scijava). As you suspected, it copies your plugin's ''.jar'' file to your ImageJ plugins folder. But you have to specify where:

<source lang="bash">
mvn -Dimagej.app.directory=/Applications/ImageJ.app
</source>

One way to do that in NetBeans is to right-click your project, select ''Custom>Goals...'' which brings up the ''Run Maven'' dialog box. Then specify '''install''' for the Goals and
'''-Dimagej.app.directory=/Applications/ImageJ.app''' for the Properties.

= How to use my own, custom ImageJ version? =

The dependencies specified in ''pom.xml'' are only used to compile your .jar file. If you set the ''imagej.app.directory'' property properly, it will copy things into the ''jars/'' subdirectory of the location you pointed the property to.

= My software depends on a ''.jar'' file that is not available via Maven! = 

The easiest way to do that would probably to install it locally for the
moment. Please see Maven's console log for details how to do that after
specifying a dependency, e.g.

<source lang="xml">
<dependency>
  <groupId>uk.ac.bham.dentistry</groupId>
  <artifactId>Particles8_</artifactId>
  <version>1.6</version>
</dependency>
</source>

It is advisable to look for the version number on the web site, as it was done here, and to construct the groupId from the web site, too.

Note that you will need to wrap the .class files in a .jar file like so:

<source lang="bash">
jar cvf Particles8_.jar Particles8_.class
</source>

Then you can install that ''.jar'' file locally with a command like:

<source lang="bash">
mvn install:install-file \
  -Dfile=/path/to/Particles8_.jar \
  -DgroupId=uk.ac.bham.dentistry -DartifactId=Particles8_ -Dversion=1.6 \
  -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true
</source>

= Can I call ''svnversion'' via Maven? =

Typically you want to do that to put the current revision into an About box or something similar.

In general, you can call any needed Ant functionality using the [http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-antrun-plugin/ maven-antrun-plugin]. However, for the About box, there is a much better solution:

The pom-scijava parent uses the buildnumber-maven-plugin to embed the SCM revision and date in the JAR manifest. You can enable this behavior by adding the following lines to your POM:

<source lang="xml">
<plugins>
  <plugin>
    <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
    <artifactId>buildnumber-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  </plugin>
</plugins>
</source>

Then, your About dialog box can access the information from the ''.jar'' file's manifest using the [http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/SciJava-common/javadoc/org/scijava/util/Manifest.html Manifest class] of {{GitHub|org=scijava|repo=scijava-common|source=org/scijava/util/Manifest.java|label=scijava-common}}.

You would need to add a dependency on ''scijava-common'' like this:

<source lang="xml">
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>${scijava-common.groupId}</groupId>
    <artifactId>ij-core</artifactId>
    <version>${scijava-common.version}</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
</source>

and then add code like this:

<source lang="java">
import org.scijava.util.Manifest;

...
    Manifest manifest = Manifest.getManifest(MyBeautifulPlugin.class);
    String version = manifest.getImplementationBuild();
</source>

= How do I make my modified project available to a depending project using Maven? =

For example, suppose you have made changes to TrakEM2 that you want to take advantage of in a plugin. Compiling with mvn may result in errors indicating that your modifications do not exist. In this case, run "mvn install" in the ''modules/TrakEM2'' directory. This should install the relevant, fresh TrakEM2 jars into the correct locations.

Also make sure that the ''groupId'', ''artifactId'' '''and''' ''version'' in the ''<dependencies>'' section of the dependencee match the settings in the dependency's ''pom.xml'' file.

= How can I run individual tests with Maven? =

As described [http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/single-test.html here]:

<source lang="bash">
mvn -Dtest='TestCircle#mytest' test
</source>

= Where can I find more information about Maven? =
