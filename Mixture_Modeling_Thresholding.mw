== Purpose ==

This plugin automatically threshold an image using the Mixture Modeling algorithm. It is an histogram-based technique that assumes that the histogram distribution is represented by two Gaussian curves.

== Documentation ==

This algorithm separates the histogram of an image into two classes using a Gaussian model. It then calculates the image threshold as the intersection of these two Gaussians. This thresholding technique has the advantage of finding a threshold that is in certain cases closer to real world data. The Gaussian parameters can also be used to describe the two regions obtained.

The plugin returns a histogram with the two Gaussians, the parameters obtained (average, standard deviation, threshold) and the thresholded image.

It has the same drawbacks as the [[Otsu Thresholding]] plugin (by the same author), which is that it behaves annoyingly with stacks.
