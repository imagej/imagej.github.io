== Purpose ==

This plugin allows the user to apply four different automatic thresholding algorithms. The four algorithms are ImageJ's built in IsoData algorithm, [[Maximum Entropy Threshold]], [[Otsu Thresholding]], and [[Mixture Modeling Thresholding|Mixture Modeling]]. More information about thresholding and the algorithms employed here can be found at the [http://www.ph.tn.tudelft.nl/Courses/FIP/noframes/fip-Segmenta.html Image Thresholding Tutorial].

== Usage ==

This plugin is quite convenient, for it groups different techniques in one. It has nevertheless a major drawback when used on stacks. When operating on a stack, it computes the threshold on the ''single'' image currently displayed, and will apply this threshold value to ''all'' of the other images, which might not be relevant.
