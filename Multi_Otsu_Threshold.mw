== Purpose ==

This plugin segments the image in classes by thresholding. It uses the same algorithm found in [[Otsu Thresholding]], but was adapted to output more than 2 classes out of the process. 

== Documentation ==

This plugin implements an algorithm described in the following paper

A thresholding algorithm will typically classify pixels in two classes (or two set of objects): the one that have their intensity lower than a certain threshold (generally, the background), and the other (the interesting features). This plugin is based on the [[Otsu Thresholding]] technique, adapted to generate ''multiple'' thresholds and ''multiple'' classes from one single image. 

For example, by setting the desired number of classes to 3 (the algorithm then needs to find 2 thresholds), one can get background pixels, bright pixels and intermediate pixels. This might be of interest for images where there is such a pixel populations. In the example depicted below, based on the blob image, one could get the background, the blobs center and the blob edges out of it.
