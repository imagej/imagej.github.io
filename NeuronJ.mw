}}[http://imagescience.org/meijering/software/neuronj/ NeuronJ] is an ImageJ plugin to facilitate the tracing and analysis of elongated image structures, such as neuronal processes, complementing [[Simple Neurite Tracer]].

NeuronJ features a friendly interface and a detailed [https://imagescience.org/meijering/software/neuronj/manual/ online manual] but can only be used to reconstruct 2D images and is not capable of [http://www.neuronland.org/NLMorphologyConverter/MorphologyFormats/SWC/Spec.html SWC] export, the most common format used in neuronal reconstructions. If you need to reconstruct three-dimensional imagery and require a program aware of SWC, we recommend using [[Simple Neurite Tracer]] instead.
