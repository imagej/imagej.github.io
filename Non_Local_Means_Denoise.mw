= Purpose =
This is an ImageJ plugin for denosing images via the non-local-means algorithm descriped in

''Antoni Buades, Bartomeu Coll, and Jean-Michel Morel, Non-Local Means Denoising, Image Processing On Line, vol. 2011.'' 

including the changes proposed by 

''Darbon, J. et al., 2008. Fast nonlocal filtering applied to electron cryomicroscopy. In 2008 5th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro, Proceedings, ISBI. IEEE, pp. 1331–1334.''

It is numerically optimized and multithreaded. It works with all image types (RGB, 32 Bit, 16 Bit, 8 Bit).

This plugin was developed within the scope of a study work of Pascal Behnel and is maintained by Thorsten Wagner (Both are members of the Biomedical Imaging Group).

=Settings=
'''Sigma:''' The sigma of the noise. 

'''Smoothing factor:''' In most cases, the default value (1) should not be changed. However, sometimes a more smoothed image is desired which can be archived by selecting values > 1.

'''Auto estimate sigma:''' If this option is selected, the sigma is automatically estimated by the method descriped in Implements the gaussian noise level estimation algorithm of  ''Immerkaer, J., 1996. Fast noise variance estimation. Computer Vision and Image Understanding.''
