[http://opencv.org/ OpenCV] is a widespread computer vision and machine learning library applied in a great variety of contexts, including life sciences. The power of OpenCV relies on the huge amount (more than 2500) of both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms provided by this library. OpenCV supplies algorithms for: image processing, feature detection, object detection, machine-learning, and video analysis. 

Currently, there are three alternatives to connect ImageJ with OpenCV:
* [https://github.com/m4dguy/CVForge CVForge]: an ImageJ plugin implementing a simple-to-use interface that gives access to all the methods of OpenCV.
* [[IJ-OpenCV|IJ-OpenCV]]: a library to create applications combining features from both ImageJ and OpenCV. From the perspective of ImageJ developers, they can use IJ-OpenCV to easily create plugins that use any functionality provided by the OpenCV library and explore different alternatives. From the perspective of OpenCV developers, this library provides a link to the ImageJ graphical user interface and all its features to handle regions of interest. 
* [https://github.com/WAKU-TAKE-A/IJToolsUsingOpenCV IJToolsUsingOpenCV]: a suite of ImageJ plugins that connects ImageJ with some of the algorithms implemented in OpenCV.
