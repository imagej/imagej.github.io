==Overview==

[[ImageJ Ops]] is an extensible framework for algorithms.  [[Deconvolution]] is a process that is used to de-blur images.  When implemented with appropriate constraints deconvolution can also de-noise images. The imagej-ops project gives algorithm developers a framework to implement, organize and test various approaches to deconvolution.

Current work is focused on:

1.  Implementation of Richardson Lucy with Total Variation Regularization, Vector Acceleration and Non-Circulant Edge handling. 

2.  Designing a framework that will make it easy for developers to extend Richardson Lucy with other types of regularization, acceleration and edge handling. 

3.  Designing a framework that will make it easy for developers to implement other types of deconvolution.

==Richardson Lucy==

[[wikipedia:Richardson%E2%80%93Lucy deconvolution|Richardson Lucy]] is an iterative deconvolution algorithm that can be used to reconstruct a blurred image.   

<math>\mathbf{o}_{k+1}(s)=\left\{\left[\frac{i(s)}{(o_{k}*h)(s)}\right]*h(-s)\right\}{o}_{k}(s)</math>

In practice the Richardson-Lucy algorithm needs to be modified to improve noise handling (regularization), improve convergence speed (acceleration) and reduce edge artifacts.

===Richardson Lucy with Total Variation Regularization===

To prevent noise amplification the Richardson Lucy algorithm should be regularized.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_%28mathematics%29     Regularization] "refers to a process of introducing additional information in order to solve an ill-posed problem or to prevent overfitting".

[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16586486 Richardson Lucy with Total Variation Regularization]

<math>\mathbf{o}_{k+1}(s) = \left\{\left[\frac{i(s)}{(o_{k}*h)(s)}\right]*h(-s)\right\}\frac{{o}_{k}(s)}{1-\lambda_{TV}div\left({\frac{\nabla_{ok}(s)}{|\nabla_{ok}(s)|}}\right)}</math>

===Richardson Lucy with Vector Acceleration===

Richardson Lucy and other iterative algorithms are often slow to converge.  Acceleration techniques speed up convergence by taking a larger step at each iteration.

===Edge handling with Non-circulant Richardson Lucy===

The proper handling of boundary conditions is an important part of deconvolution.  Images are finite and usually treated as circulant.  Thus when deconvolving (or convolving) images are usually extended (padded) to prevent boundary artifacts.  A novel approach, to handle edge artifacts, was introduced as part of the 2014 international grand challenge on deconvolution.  This approach uses non-circulant convolution operators.
