This page will give you an idea how Fiji's source code is organized.  Every directory referred to is relative to the Fiji root, i.e. the directory into which you [[Git mini howto#Cloning|cloned fiji.git]].

== The Fiji launcher ==

The [[Fiji Launcher]] is now called ''ImageJ launcher'' and lives {{GitHub|org=imagej|repo=imagej-launcher|label=in its own repository}}. It is [http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/ImageJ-launcher built by Jenkins].

== The plugins ==

The plugins served from Fiji's update site are all [[Why Closed-Source Is Wrong|Open Source]]. The source code lives {{GitHub|org=fiji|repo=|label=on GitHub}}, in repositories reflecting the name of the ''.jar'' file generated from the source code. Example: the source code for ''Fiji_Plugins.jar'' lives in https://github.com/fiji/Fiji_Plugins.

The only special rule applies for plugins whose file names end in an underscore: that underscore will be stripped. Example: the sources of ''Arrow_.jar'' are stored in https://github.com/fiji/Arrow.

All of our plugins are maintained as [[Maven]] projects; this allows developers to build the code with their integrated development environment of choice.

Plugins maintained in Maven projects consist of

# a pom.xml file in the top-level directory
# the Java sources in the ''src/main/java/'' directory, and
# the ''plugins.config'' file in ''src/main/resources/''

If the plugin sources contain unit tests, their sources are in ''src/test/java/'' so that the generated test classes will not be included in the final ''.jar'' file.

== Libraries ==

Most libraries are available as regular [[Maven]] dependencies (you can [http://search.maven.org/ search for them on Maven Central]).

== Submodules ==

Fiji used to maintain relationships with projects developed outside the ''fiji.git'' repository via Git submodules. This proved too cumbersome and too unintuitive for the affected parties.

All submodule couplings are now replaced by proper [[Maven]] dependency management.

== The Fiji Build system ==

Fiji used to have its home-brewn build system. We switched to using [[Maven]] in 2012, though.

For convenience, there is a {{GitHub|org=scijava|repo=minimaven|label=''Mini Maven''}} project that allows building Fiji without a full-blown Maven; however, for serious development, real Maven, or even better, Eclipse or Netbeans is recommended.

For backwards-compatibility, ''Mini Maven'' can be called via '''./Build.sh''' in the top-level directory of a ''fiji.git'' checkout. Despite the name, it does not really build anything, but only draws in all Fiji components as [[Maven]] dependencies.

== The ''bin/'' directory ==

Quite a few tasks -- such as committing a new submodule or sources for a plugin, or releasing a new version of Fiji -- are performed by scripts.  These scripts live in the ''<Fiji-root>/bin/'' subdirectory.

Some of these scripts are shell scripts, others are Jython scripts with special [[wikipedia:Shebang (Unix)|shebang]] lines which trigger them to be called with the current Fiji launcher.
