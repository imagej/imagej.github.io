{{Learn}}ImageJ has been extended with thousands of [[wikipedia:Plug-in (computing)|plugins]]: special-purpose software components that extend ImageJ’s functionality—e.g., by offering additional commands via menu entries.

== Available plugins ==

{{BigNotice | You can browse the [[:Category:Plugins|list of available plugins]].}}

== Tiers of plugins ==

There are four tiers of plugins:
# Core ImageJ plugins, bundled with the base ImageJ distribution. (more than 1000 as of this writing)
# Core Fiji plugins, bundled with the [[Fiji]] distribution of ImageJ. (nearly 1000 additional plugins as of this writing)
# Plugins installable from an ImageJ [[update site]].
# Additional plugins available from various online sources, which must be manually installed.

== Installing plugins ==

The ImageJ [[Updater]] is the best way to install and update plugins. Simply [[Update Sites|add the update site]] containing your plugins of interest, and they will be installed automatically for you.
If the plugin is not available via update site, but packaged as ''.jar'' file, or as unpackaged directory with ''.class'' files, see [[#Installing_plugins_manually|Installing plugins manually]] below.

== Advanced topics ==

=== Installing plugins manually ===

If the plugin you want is not distributed via an ImageJ update site, please encourage the plugin's maintainer to do so! Anyone can create their own [[personal update site]] hosted on [http://sites.imagej.net/ sites.imagej.net], freeing plugin authors from the burden of distribution and server maintenance.

In the meantime, to install a plugin manually, follow the plugin's installation instructions, if any. The plugin will consist of one or more files which must be downloaded and (typically) placed in ImageJ's <tt>plugins</tt> folder:
* If the file suffix is <tt>.jar</tt> or <tt>.class</tt> then it is usually enough to simply restart ImageJ after dropping the file into <tt>plugins</tt>.
* If the file suffix is <tt>.java</tt> then you typically must execute the [http://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-31.html#toc-Subsection-31.5 Compile and Run] command on the file to first compile it to a <tt>.class</tt>. After running this command once and restarting ImageJ, the plugin will become available in ImageJ's <tt>Plugins</tt> menu.

See also the [[Installing 3rd party plugins]] guide.

=== User-specific plugins ===

In addition to looking in the <tt>plugins</tt> folder of ImageJ itself, ImageJ also looks in the <tt>.plugins</tt> folder in the current user's home folder. This is useful if you want to install some of your own plugins without affecting the system-wide ImageJ installation.

=== Configuring where ImageJ looks for plugins ===

Power users may wish to configure exactly which folder(s) ImageJ scans for plugins. The default folder is the <tt>plugins</tt> folder of the ImageJ installation. However, this can be overridden using the <tt>plugins.dir</tt> system property. See the ImageJ web site's article [http://imagej.net/docs/menus/plugins.html#dir Changing Location of Plugins Directory].

=== Multiple plugin directories ===

For ultimate control, ImageJ also provides support for manually configuring the list of plugin paths, similar to Java's classpath, using the <tt>ij1.plugin.dirs</tt> system property.

E.g., 

* on 64-bit Linux:

 $IJ_DIR/ImageJ-linux64 -Dij1.plugin.dirs=$IJ_DIR/jars:$IJ_DIR/plugins:$HOME/.plugins

* On OS X:

 $IJ_DIR/Contents/MacOS/ImageJ-macosx -Dij1.plugin.dirs=$IJ_DIR/jars:$IJ_DIR/plugins:$HOME/.plugins

* On 64-bit Windows:

 %IJ_DIR%\ImageJ-win64 -Dij1.plugin.dirs=%IJ_DIR%\jars;%IJ_DIR%\plugins;%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\.plugins

Where <tt>$IJ_DIR</tt> (or <tt>%IJ_DIR%</tt> on Windows) is the path to your ImageJ installation.
