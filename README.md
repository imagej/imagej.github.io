## Cloning this repository

If you clone this repository, you can use Jekyll to build the site locally.
Find instructions in the [Advanced Editing](https://imagej.net/editing) guide.

This approach is more complex than editing individual pages via GitHub's online
interface, but it is more powerful, with a much faster edit-debug cycle.
