{{ComponentStats:io.scif:scifio}}[http://scif.io/ SCIFIO] is a flexible framework for '''SC'''ientific '''I'''mage '''F'''ormat '''I'''nput and '''O'''utput. In other words, it is a library for reading and writing N-dimensional image data—e.g., to and from files on disk. SCIFIO is built on the [[SciJava Common]] library.

[[ImageJ2]] uses SCIFIO by default for most image input tasks. You can change this behavior at any time by running {{bc | Edit | Options | ImageJ2}} and modifying the ''Use SCIFIO when opening files'' option.

== Benefits of using SCIFIO ==

SCIFIO is focused on robust and extensible support for reading and writing image file formats. Using it with ImageJ provides many advantages:

* There is no need to call a special SCIFIO plugin; it works with commands like {{bc | File | Open}} automatically.
* There are additional import options available via the {{bc | File | Import | Image...}} command.
* There is a [[Bio-Formats]] plugin for SCIFIO, included with the [[Fiji]] distribution of ImageJ, that adds automatic support for over a hundred life sciences file formats.
* Additional SCIFIO file format plugins can be dropped into ImageJ and will also work automatically.
* Unlike the ImageJ 1.x TIFF implementation, SCIFIO's support for TIFF adheres to the specification, allowing to successfully read many more sorts of TIFFs.
* Similarly, SCIFIO supports more sorts of JPEG files since it uses its own JPEG decoder.
* SCIFIO also ships with support for several QuickTime codecs, allowing ImageJ to read QuickTime MOV files even in 64-bit mode without QuickTime for Java.
* SCIFIO supports many additional open file formats out of the box:
** animated GIF
** animated PNG
** encapsulated postscript (EPS)
** JPEG-2000
** Micro-Manager datasets
** Multi-image Network Graphics (MNG)
** Nearly Raw Raster Data (NRRD)
** Imspector OBF
** OME-TIFF (multidimensional rich metadata TIFF)
** OME-XML
** PCX
** PICT (even in 64-bit mode and/or without QuickTime for Java installed)
* If SCIFIO cannot handle the image file, it falls back to ImageJ 1.x.
* You can save to SCIFIO-supported file formats using the {{bc | File | Export | Image...}} command. Supported formats for export include:
** APNG
** AVI
** EPS
** ICS
** JPEG
** JPEG2000
** QuickTime
** TIFF

== Current limitations of SCIFIO ==

* SCIFIO is still in beta, so there is likely to be a higher incidence of bugs. Issues can be reported on the [https://github.com/scifio/scifio/issues SCIFIO issue tracker].
* Although we strive for full backwards compatibility, some files may appear slightly different when opened.
* Opening files with SCIFIO is not fully macro recordable yet.
