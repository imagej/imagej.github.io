	</li>
	<dl><dd>
	Loading of images that require input options is handled by ImageJ directly. To load a directory of images (e.g., one file per Z-slice), run {{bc|color=white|File| Import|Image Sequence}} and select the first file in the sequence, adjusting any needed parameters in the subsequent dialog prompt. Once the sequence is imported adjust voxel dimensions using {{bc|color=white|Image|Properties...}}. To save yourself from having to go through these steps again, you should save the imported stack as a single TIFF file using {{bc|color=white|File|Save As|Tiff...}}

	<span id="snt"></span>'''What is the difference between SNT and Simple Neurite Tracer'''?
	</li>
	<dl><dd>
Simple Neurite Tracer was the first Fiji plugin dedicated to visualization and reconstruction of neurons, developed by [[User:Mark|Mark Longair]] and [[#citing|published in 2011]], to become the single most cited open-source software for semi-automated 3D reconstructions. In the wake of ImageJ2 development, a new team of developers lead by [[User:Tiago|Tiago Ferreira]] took on the effort of modernizing its code base. The project quickly snowballed beyond the re-write of the software, and focused on establishing a complete framework for reconstruction, visualization, quantification and modelling of neuronal morphology. Several name changes were proposed for this "next-gen" Simple Neurite Tracer (''Not so Simple Neurite Tracer'', ''Smart Neurite Tracer'', to name a few), but in the end it was decided to adopt the acronym of the original software, as an homage to Mark's outstanding work. You can follow the entire history of the plugin on {{GitHub|org=fiji|repo=Simple_Neurite_Tracer|label=GitHub}}.

	<span id="swc"></span>'''What is a SWC file'''?
	</li>
	<dl><dd>
	It is the most widely adopted format for encoding neuronal reconstructions, in which information is stored in plain text. It was first described by (Cannon et al., 1998) and since then became a somewhat loose ''lingua franca'' of a neuron's three dimensional structure. It is described in more detail [http://www.neuronland.org/NLMorphologyConverter/MorphologyFormats/SWC/Spec.html here] and [https://neuroinformatics.nl/swcPlus/ here]. SNT supports all known variants of the format including [https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017207 ESWC] and [https://neuroinformatics.nl/swcPlus/ SWC+]. The extension stems from the last names of Stockley, Wheal, and Cole, who developed a neat computer system for reconstructing neuronal cells ( Stockley et al., 1993). Confusingly, it is also a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_SWC_file deprecated file format] used by Adobe.

	</li>
	<dl><dd>
When tracing 4D or 5D images, <tt>TRACES</tt> is preferable because the channel and/or time frame associated with the data are stored. With simpler 2/3D images <tt>TRACES</tt> is also preferable to preserve [[SNT:_Overview#Tag|Path Manager tags]] across restarts. Note that the {{bc|[[SNT:_Overview#Scripts|Scripts]]|&nbsp;}} provides a batch converter for  <tt>TRACES</tt> &rarr; <tt>SWC</tt>  conversion. The following table summarizes the differences between the two formats:
{| class="wikitable" style="width: 100%"|
! 
! style="text-align: center;" | SWC
! style="text-align: center;" | TRACES
|-
| style="width: 20%"| No. reconstructions / file
| style="width: 40%"|  Only one. When multiple reconstructions exits, SNT splits them across multiple files appending unique suffixes to filenames
| style="width: 40%"|  Multiple reconstructions per file allowed
|-
| Image metadata
| Only spatial calibration
| Stored. Including channel and frame of the traced structure
|-
| [[SNT:_Overview#Tag|Path Manager tags]]
| Not stored
| Stored
|-
| Format
| Plain text
| XML or compressed XML (as per [[SNT:_Overview#Misc|preferences]])
