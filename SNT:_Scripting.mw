==SNT API==
The full up-to-date SNT API can be found at [http://fiji.github.io/SNT/ http://fiji.github.io/SNT/]

==Script Templates==
SNT comes packaged with script templates demonstrating 
various analysis, tracing, image processing and utility routines. These templates can be found both in the ''Scripts'' menu of the SNT dialog and in the {{bc|Templates|Neuroanatomy}} menu of Fiji's Script Editor. Scripts can be written in any language supported by Fiji's Script Editor.

===Analysis===
'''Analysis_Demo.py'''  A Jython demo of how SNT can analyze neuronal reconstructions fetched from online databases such as MouseLight, NeuroMorpho or FlyCircuit. This demo requires internet connection and assumes you've already ran Analysis_Demo_(Interactive).py 

'''Analysis_Demo_(Interactive).py'''  Exemplifies how to programmatically interact with a running instance of SNT to analyze traced data. Because of all the GUI updates, this approach is _significantly slower_ than analyzing reconstructions directly (see Analysis_Demo.py for comparison)

'''Download_ML_Data.groovy'''  Exemplifies how to programmatically retrieve data from MouseLight's database at [//ml-neuronbrowser.janelia.org ml-neuronbrowser.janelia.org]: It iterates through all the neurons in the server and downloads data (both JSON and SWC formats) for cells with soma associated with the specified Allen Reference Atlas (ARA) compartment. Downloaded files will contain all metadata associated with the cell (i.e., labeling used, strain, etc.) For advanced queries, have a look at MouseLightQuerier.

'''Get_Branch_Points_in_Brain_Compartment.groovy'''  Exemplifies how to extract morphometric properties of a MouseLight cell associated with a specific brain region/neuropil compartment. Requires internet connection.

'''Graph_Analysis.py'''  Demonstrates how to handle neurons as graph structures [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory (graph theory)] in which nodes connected by edges define the morphology of the neuron. SNT represents neurons as directed graphs (assuming the root -typically the soma- as origin) and allows data be processed using the powerful [https://jgrapht.org/ jgrapht] library. In this demo, the [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GraphDiameter.html graph diameter] (i.e., the length of the longest shortest path or the longest graph geodesic) of a cellular compartment is computed for a neuron fetched from the MouseLight database.

'''Reconstruction_Viewer_Demo.py'''  Exemplifies how to render reconstructions and neuropil annotations in a stand-alone Reconstruction Viewer. Requires internet connection.

'''SciView_Demo.groovy'''  Exemplifies how bridge SNT with [https://imagej.net/SciView SciView].

===Sholl===

'''Extensive_Sholl_Stats.groovy'''  Exemplifies how to perform linear and polynomial regression on tabular Sholl data. 

===Boilerplate===
This menu hosts script templates containing extensible boilerplate code in several programming languages. The most essential imports and script parameters are included to facilitate rapid development.

'''BSH.bsh''' A boilerplate script template in the [https://beanshell.github.io/ BeanShell] programming language. 

'''GVY.groovy''' A boilerplate script template in the [https://groovy-lang.org/ Apache Groovy] programming language.

'''PY.py''' - A boilerplate script template in the [https://www.python.org/ Python] programming language.

===Tracing===

'''Scripted_Tracing_Demo.py'''  Exemplifies how to programmatically perform A* tracing between two points without GUI interaction, which allows for automated tracing of relatively simple structures (e.g., neurospheres neurites, microtubule bundles, etc). In this demo, points are retrieved from the SWC file of SNT's "demo tree", effectively recreating the initial SWC data.

'''Scripted_Tracing_Demo_(Interactive).py'''  Exemplifies how to programmatically interact with a running instance of SNT to perform auto-tracing tasks.

'''Take_Snapshot.py'''  Displays a WYSIWYG image of a tracing canvas. Exemplifies how to script SNT using SNTService.

===Batch===

'''Convert_Traces_to_SWC.py'''  Converts all .traces files in a directory into SWC.

'''Filter_Multiple_Images.py'''  Bulk filtering of image files using Frangi Vesselness.

'''Measure_Multiple_Files.py'''  Bulk measurements of reconstruction files using SNT.

'''Measure_Multiple_Files_(With_Options).groovy''' Bulk measurements (with options to choose a subset of measurements) of reconstruction files using SNT.

'''Render_Cell_Collection.groovy'''  Exemplifies how to quickly render large collections of cells from a directory of files (900 MouseLight reconstructions rendered in ~30s on a 4 core i7 (ubuntu 18.10) without a discrete graphics card).

'''Render_Cell_Collection_(MultiPanel_Figure).groovy'''  Exemplifies how to generate a publication-quality multi-panel figure in which multiple reconstructions are sorted and color-coded by a specified morphometric trait (cable length in this example). The script prompts for a directory containing the reconstruction files to be analyzed. If no directory is specified, the script will parse a collection of dendritic arbors from the MouseLight database instead.

==Python Notebooks==
Direct access to the SNT API from the [https://www.python.org/ Python] programming language is made possible through the [https://pypi.org/project/pyimagej/ pyimagej] module. This enables full integration between SNT and any library in the Python ecosystem.
===Installing pyimagej===
Follow the instructions given [https://github.com/imagej/pyimagej#installation here]
===Getting Started===
To initialize Fiji from Python with GUI capabilities:
<source lang="python">
import imagej
ij = imagej.init('sc.fiji:fiji', headless=False)
</source>
Then, use [https://github.com/kivy/pyjnius pyjnius] (bundled with pyimagej) to import the SNT (Java) classes you need. For example, to download a neuron reconstruction from the MouseLight database and calculate summary statistics on it, you would import the [http://javadoc.scijava.org/Fiji/tracing/io/MouseLightLoader MouseLightLoader] and [http://javadoc.scijava.org/Fiji/tracing/analysis/TreeStatistics.html TreeStatistics] classes:

<source lang="python">
from jnius import autoclass
MouseLightLoader = autoclass('tracing.io.MouseLightLoader')
TreeStatistics   = autoclass('tracing.analysis.TreeStatistics')
</source>
Now you can access all the attributes and methods these classes offer. Let's get a summary of the inter-node distances for a specific mouse cortical motor neuron (ID = "AA0100" in the [http://ml-neuronbrowser.janelia.org/ MouseLight database]). 
<source lang="python">
def run():
    loader = MouseLightLoader("AA0100")
    if not loader.isDatabaseAvailable():
        print("Could not connect to ML database", "Error")
        return
    if not loader.idExists():
        print("Somehow the specified id was not found", "Error")
        return

    a_tree = loader.getTree('axon', None) # compartment, color
    s_stats = TreeStatistics(a_tree)
    metric = TreeStatistics.INTER_NODE_DISTANCE
    summary_stats = s_stats.getSummaryStats(metric)
    s_stats.getHistogram(metric).show()
    print("The average inter-node distance is %d" % summary_stats.getMean())
</source>

===Advanced Examples===
The [https://github.com/fiji/Simple_Neurite_Tracer/tree/scijava/notebooks Notebooks] directory in the SNT [https://github.com/fiji/Simple_Neurite_Tracer GitHub repository] contains examples which are executable on [https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ Binder].
For example, to run the convex_hull notebook via [https://mybinder.org/ mybinder.org], follow this link: [https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fiji/Simple_Neurite_Tracer/scijava?filepath=%2Fnotebooks%2Fconvex_hull.ipynb convex_hull.ipynb]

==Scripting Reconstruction Viewer==
Programmatic control over an open instance of Reconstruction Viewer (either called from within SNT or as a standalone application) can be achieved by selecting the {{bc|Tools & Utilities|Script This Viewer...}} command from RV Controls. This command will open an instance of Fiji's script editor with a boilerplate template containing the most essential imports and script parameters used by Reconstruction Viewer. The default programming language for this template can be chosen from the drop-down menu of the ''Preferred Language'' option after navigating to {{bc|Tools & Utilities|Preferences...}} from the RV Controls. Currently supported languages include Python, Apache Groovy and BeanShell.

The following script exemplifies how to extend the boilerplate template to control the Viewer in real-time.

<source lang="python">
#@ Context context
#@ DatasetService ds
#@ DisplayService display
#@ ImageJ ij
#@ LegacyService ls
#@ LogService log
#@ LUTService lut
#@ SNTService snt
#@ UIService ui
