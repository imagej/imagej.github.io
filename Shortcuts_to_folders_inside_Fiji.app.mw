Right click on Fiji.app and choose "Show Package Contents":

This will open a new window showing the folders inside Fiji.app:

Pressing both option (⌥) and cmd (⌘) keys, drag and drop the folders you want easy access to (here "plugins") in your "Fiji" folder, next to Fiji.app:

This will create an alias (labeled by a small arrow in the lower left corner of the icon) to the chosen folder:

Do the same drag and drop with option and cmd to make aliases of all folders inside Fiji.app you want easy access to:

When you will need access to those folders, for exemple the "luts" folder in the Dialog opened by "Color {{arrow}} Edit LUT {{arrow}} Open...", you will be able to get into the folder easily using the alias:
