{{DevelopMenu}}The source code of ImageJ is very modular; i.e., it is organized into [[Architecture#Modularity|well-separated]] projects. This separation offers many advantages for efficient software development and it is well worth investing a little bit of time to understand.

== Where is the code? ==
{{Tip | tip=You can search the source code at http://search.imagej.net/ using the GitHub button!}}* All source code is on [[GitHub]]. 
* Each project exists in its own GitHub organization. 
* Each organization contains multiple source code repositories.
* Each repository corresponds to one Java library (.jar file).

See the [[Architecture]] page for more information about the relationship between these projects.

== What is the license? ==

Most is [[BSD-2]] (permissive); some is [[GPL]] (copyleft). See the [[Licensing]] page.

== Building from source ==

Virtually all of these repositories have a top-level <code>pom.xml</code> file, identifying them as [[Maven]] projects.

To build a Maven project:

# [http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html Install Maven].
# Clone the source repository of interest.
# Type <code>mvn</code> from the top-level directory.

Advanced instructions for building, or modifying, the source code are available for specific development environments:

Note that these tutorials are targeted towards [[ImageJ]], but would apply to any Maven-based project.

== Javadocs ==

== Running ImageJ1 unit tests ==

We have written a substantial number of unit tests to exercise [[ImageJ 1.x]] functionality. See the [[Unit tests for ImageJ1]] page for more information.
