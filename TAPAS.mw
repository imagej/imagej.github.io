== TAPAS : An integrated tool for batch processing and analysis of multi-dimensional images ==
'''TAPAS''' (Towards an Automated Processing and Analysis System) is a framework for processing and analysis workflow for multi-dimensional images. A workflow is a series of modules linked together to process an image, each module should perform one simple task. 

The first idea is to design a framework where '''users''' can share the pipeline as simple text file. The second idea is to create a simple programming template so '''developers''' can create their own module.

Finally, the pipeline should be separated from the set of images to process, so a same pipeline can be used for different images. The results of the processing and the analysis should be stored along with the processed images.

Here we propose modules to process and analyze images stored in an OMERO database, but the system should work fine with files stored locally or on a server.

== Author ==
Thomas Boudier

== Features ==
Basically we will propose modules from the [[3D_ImageJ_Suite]], ImageJ/Fiji, along with other modules.

As for stable version 0.5 the following modules are available :
* Input/Output to files (using BioFormats)
* Input/Output to OMERO
* 2D/3D filtering
* Auto-threshold, hysteresis and Iterative thresholding
* 2D/3D labeling
* Objects measurements, signal quantification and numbering
* Colocalisation and distances
* Calling ImageJ macros and executables

== Installation ==
* Install [https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/ ImageJ] or [http://fiji.sc/ Fiji].

* Install [[3D_ImageJ_Suite]]. It is also available as a update site in Fiji. '''ImageScience''' should be installed too, either from [http://www.imagescience.org/meijering/software/featurej/ here] or via the update site in Fiji.

* Install Bioformats, either by downloading [https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/downloads/ bioformats_package.jar] or by enabling the update site in Fiji.
 
* If you have an OMERO server, download [https://www.openmicroscopy.org/omero/downloads/ OMERO-insight], unzip OMERO.insight-ij-xxx.zip into the plugins directory of ImageJ or Fiji. The version number should match the version number of your server. Please do not install OMERO-insight from the Fiji update site.

* Download [[File:Bundle-tapas0.51.zip]] and unzip it into the ImageJ or Fiji directory.

TAPAS was tested successfully with OMERO.insight 5.5.5 and Bioformats 6.0.1.

== Usage / Tutorials ==
* If you want to process data stored on an Omero server, connect first to your server using '''TAPAS Connect''' inside the TAPAS menu.

* '''Create your pipeline''' in a text editor, check available tapas modules and how to use it in the documentation provided.

* Run ''TAPAS OMERO'' if you want to process data from Omero or ''TAPAS FILES'' for data on files.
