{{FormatsMenu}}The [[wikipedia:TIFF|TIFF file format]] is one of the most widely used formats in biosciences. Many commercial instruments write images using some flavor of TIFF. It is used in [[open source]] efforts as well; for example, the [[OME|Open Microscopy Environment]] developed the [http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/ome-model/ome-tiff/ OME-TIFF format] as an open exchange standard for microscopy data.

== ImageJ 1.x support ==

[[ImageJ 1.x]] (and therefore [[ImageJ2]] in its default legacy mode) has built-in support for TIFF files via the {{bc | File | Open...}} command.

You can also import TIFFs as [https://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-8.html#sub:Virtual-Stacks virtual stacks] via the {{bc | File | Import | TIFF Virtual Stack...}} command.

* '''Pro:''' The ImageJ 1.x TIFF reader is very fast.
* '''Con:''' The ImageJ 1.x TIFF support is incomplete. Some valid baseline TIFF files will not open properly. In particular, TIFF files with out-of-order planes cannot be opened.

== Bio-Formats ==

The [[Bio-Formats]] plugins offer a more complete TIFF importer, accessible via the {{bc | File | Import | Bio-Formats}} command.

* '''Pro:''' The Bio-Formats TIFF reader can handle many more varieties of TIFF.
* '''Con:''' The Bio-Formats TIFF support is not as speedy as ImageJ1's TIFF reader.

== SCIFIO ==

The [[SCIFIO]] library, the I/O library of [[ImageJ2]], imports TIFF files using code adapted from the [[Bio-Formats]] project. As such, it is similar to Bio-Formats in that it supports a wider variety of TIFFs, but is less performant than the ImageJ 1.x reader. SCIFIO is accessible via the {{bc | File | Import | Image...}} command.
