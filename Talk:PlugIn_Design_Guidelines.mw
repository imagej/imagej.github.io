isnt much of this obsoleted in imageJ2, in that the script editor can no onger compile and run .java????


Yeah, there is a mix of still-relevant, and now-obsolete information. Note that the Script Editor still ''can'' compile and run Java code. But we are really phasing out usage of the Fiji/ImageJ launcher to do that stuff, in favor of properly structured Maven projects (which the Script Editor can actually generate for you...). Anyway, for now I just slapped the Outdated template on it as a warning. [[User:Rueden|Rueden]] ([[User talk:Rueden|talk]])
