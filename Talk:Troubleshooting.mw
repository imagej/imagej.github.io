==Things to do...==

Many of the topics here could user more explanation about why and when they would be used
* Can mention why would we need to know java version required
* There are two ways to create such a snapshotknown as a "thread dump" or "stack trace". – not clear

We need an info link back to the [[Debugging]] page and perhaps a pass over the content to make sure the concerns of the pages are nicely separated (user vs developer-facing content)

Other improvements
* In “the other debug mode” debugitude – information on debugging, when to report a bug (via sidebar)
* Unsupported Class Version Error,   How to upgrade Java version – can add link
* NoSuchMethodError: “Once you determine which update site(s) causes the issue, you can create a separate copy of ImageJ with only the unproblematic site(s) enabled” – needs to be reworded to clarify that multiple ImageJ installations are being recommended
