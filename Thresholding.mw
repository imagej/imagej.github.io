{{TOC}}[[wikipedia:Thresholding (image processing)|Thresholding]] is a technique for dividing an image into two (or more) classes of pixels, which are typically called "foreground" and "background."

== Global thresholding ==
Global thresholding works by choosing a value cutoff, such that every pixel less than that value is considered one class, while every pixel greater than that value is considered the other class.

[[ImageJ]] provides several built-in methods for automatically computing a global threshold. For details, see:
* Documentation for the [https://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-28.html#sub:Threshold...%5BT%5D Threshold...] command.
* The [[Auto Threshold]] plugin page

== Local thresholding ==
Local thresholding techniques adapt the threshold value on each pixel to the local image characteristics.

== ImageJ Ops ==
The [[ImageJ Ops]] project provides algorithms for both global and local thresholding.

=== How do I know whether my threshold is correct? ===
In short, you can't. It will always be, to some extent, in the eye of the user/observer/scientist and will also be impacted by empirically collected knowledge. The basic problem of deciding if a threshold (or in general an extraction method) is "good" needs a "ground truth". But such a ground truth is not naturally existing and is always created in one or the other way by a human. So, describing which method you use—and/or showing a comparison with other methods—is probably the best you can do to enable a statement on the quality of the extraction.
