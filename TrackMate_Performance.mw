<b> This is a very incomplete DRAFT </b>

== The test machine ==

The computer used for these tests is the following:

  Mac¬Pro
  mi-2010
  Processor  2 x 2.66 GHz 6-Core Intel Xeon
  Memory  24 GB 1333 MHz DDR3 ECC
  Software  Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5 (11G63)


== Time of execution. == 

The tests reported here were run on an Apple MacPro, 2 x 2.66 GHz 6-Core Intel Xeon, 24 Go 1333 MHz DDR3, running Mac OS X v10.7.5, with Java 1.6. The detectors instantiated were tamed to use only 1 thread. Unless indicated, the median filter and the sub-pixel localization were not done. 

=== The DoG & LoG detectors. ===


==== Processing time for a 2D image as a function of its size. ====

For a ''uint16'' image, varying its size, containing 200 gaussian spots of radius 3 (everything is in pixel units).

For the DoG detector, unsurprisingly, we find that the execution time is proportional to the number of pixels, following approximately ''t (ms) = 3.4e-4 x Npixels''. This is expected as all calculations are done in direct space.

The LoG detector operates in Fourier space, and because of the Fourier transform implementation we use, the images are padded with 0s to reach a size equal to a power of 2. This does not show here as all but one tests are made with such a size. Still, the execution time slightly deviates from the linear case, and shows a slight quadratic shape. The best linear fit yields a low in ''t (ms) = 2.8e-4 x Npixels'', showing that the LoG detector is slightly quicker than the DoG detector.

And again, the processing time is found to be linear with the number of pixels. The linear fit is slightly steeper, however: ''t (ms) = 4.6e-4 x Npixels'', which we attribute to the 3D kernel overhead.

Interestingly, the LoG detector seems to become the slowest at intermediate size, which I cannot interpret well.

==== Processing time for a 2D image as a function of the spot radius. ====

We used a 1024x1024 ''uint16'' image, with 200 gaussian spots, the size of which we varied. The detector was tuned to this radius.

We find the processing time to increase linearly with the specified radius, following approximately ''t (ms) = 20.5 x radius + 260''. As the difference-of-gaussians is calculated in the direct space, a marked increase is expected as there is more pixels to iterate over. Without optimization, we should however have found the time to be increasing with the square of the radius, and find the same dependence that for the image size. Thanks to the clever implementation of gaussian filtering<ref>https://github.com/imagej/imglib/blob/master/algorithms/core/src/main/java/net/imglib2/algorithm/gauss3/Gauss3.java</ref>, this is avoided.


==== Processing time for a 3D image as a function of the spot radius. ====

This time we used a 256x256x256 3D image, but with otherwise the same parameters.

The processing time increases, but this time deviates slightly from linearity.
