{{Project|ImageJ1}}We have [[2011-10-07 - Unit tests for ImageJ 1.45|written a substantial number of unit tests]] to exercise [[ImageJ 1.x]] functionality. You can find them in the {{GitHub|org=imagej|repo=ij1-tests|label=ij1-tests repository}}:
<source lang="bash">
git clone git://github.com/imagej/ij1-tests
</source>
There is a [http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/ImageJ1-unit-tests/ Jenkins job] that automatically runs the tests with each new version of ImageJ 1.x.

=== Running the tests ===

If you wish to run the unit tests manually, you can do so from the command line:
<source lang="bash">
cd ij1-tests
mvn clean test
</source>
Or from Eclipse:

# Import the <code>ij1-tests</code> project using {{bc | File | Import Existing Maven Projects}} and choosing the <code>ij1-tests/pom.xml</code> file.
# Right-click the <code>ij1-tests</code> project, {{bc | Run As | JUnit Test}}.

=== Using a different version of ImageJ1 ===

You can change which version of ImageJ1 is tested by overridding the <code>imagej1.version</code> property:
<source lang="bash">
mvn -Dimagej1.version=1.48a clean test
</source>
Or whichever version you wish to use (of [http://maven.imagej.net/content/groups/public/net/imagej/ij/ those listed here]). The unit tests were created circa 1.44, and do not compile correctly with earlier versions of ImageJ.
