{{UpdateSitesMenu}}An '''update site''' is web space used by the [[Updater]] which enables users to share their macros, scripts and plugins with other researchers. With update sites, you do not need to manually download and install anything; [[ImageJ]] takes care of it for you.

== Following an update site ==

<div style="clear: right; float: right">{{Fiji | The [[Fiji]] distribution of ImageJ ships with both the ''ImageJ'' and ''Fiji'' sites enabled.

To enable additional features, choose {{bc|Help|Update...}}, then click the "Manage update sites" button.

== Creating your own update site ==

Anyone can share their extensions ([[plugins]], [[scripts]], etc.) by [[How to set up and populate an update site|creating their own update site]]. You can use ImageJ's [[personal update site]] service (hosted on the [http://sites.imagej.net/ ImageJ web server]), or host it on your own server.
