{{UpdateSites}}

An '''update site''' is web space used by the [[Updater]] which enables users to share their macros, scripts and plugins with other researchers. With update sites, you do not need to manually download and install anything; [[ImageJ]] takes care of it for you.

== Following an update site ==

{{Fiji | The [[Fiji]] distribution of ImageJ ships with both the ''ImageJ'' and ''Fiji'' sites enabled. You can transform your ImageJ installation into a Fiji one simply by enabling the ''Fiji'' update site.}}Out of the box, ImageJ has only the core ''ImageJ'' update site enabled.
* To enable additional features, choose ''Update'' from the ''Help'' menu, then click the "Manage update sites" button.

For further details, see [[How to follow a 3rd party update site]].

== Creating your own update site ==

Anyone can share their extensions ([[plugins]], [[scripts]], etc.) by '''creating their own update site'''. You can use ImageJ's '''personal update site''' service (hosted on the [http://sites.imagej.net/ ImageJ web server]), or host it on your own server.

See [[How to set up and populate an update site]] for instructions.
