The Microscopy Core in the department of oncology at the University of Oxford was established in 2014 and houses a range of microscopic and nanoscopic imaging systems.

Techniques currently available include:
Airyscan Super-Resolution Microscopy
Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy
Multi-photon Excitation Microscopy
Widefield Microscopy including fluorescence, DIC and Phase-contrast
Plate Scanning Image Cytometer
Image Analysis Expertise

The Microscopy Core aims to provide research groups with cutting edge imaging technologies to allow the investigation of cellular processes both in vitro and in vivo.
