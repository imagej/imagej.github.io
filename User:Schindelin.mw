= A short story about Fiji =

This story is not about [http://en.wikipedia.org/index.php/Fiji the island called ''Fiji'']. This story is how [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de Fiji Is Just ImageJ] became born.

== The beginning ==

Back when I met [http://albert.rierol.net Albert Cardona] at the [http://imagejconf.tudor.lu/doku.php?id=archive:imagej-user-and-developer-conference-2006 first ImageJ conference], it became pretty apparent pretty quickly that not only would we become good friends, but also that we had a lot of mutual respect for the work we had done so far. His biggest accomplishment was certainly [[TrakEM2]], but he had also worked on the macro interpreter (including a so-called [[Macro Interpreter|Command Line Interface]], which is a two-paned window for interactive macro evaluation) and had already turned to [[Jython_Scripting|Jython]] as a more powerful way to script ImageJ. At that time, I had not worked all that many years with ImageJ, but I already was maintainer of [[ImageJA]].

Over the years, we had more and more contact, meeting briefly in [http://genetics.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de/main/ Würzburg] and later at a [[Hackathon|hackathon]] at [http://www.hhmi.org/bulletin/nov2007/chronicle/hackathon.html Janelia Farms], where we met with a bunch of enthusiastic people who all tried to bridge neuro science with software development (even if I was there, the article does not show a photo of me, because they did the article in the second week, and back then I was not on too-good terms with my employer, so I dared only ask to leave for one).

After an exciting hackathon, you almost always have to take a few breaths for a couple of weeks. In other words, you are no longer as productive, and if you are a workaholic like me, you fall into a depression.

It helped much to stay in contact and chat frequently. I did that a lot, especially with Albert, who kept improving TrakEM2. He also asked me constantly: "Johannes, have you tried it yet? You'll like it, it has a lot of features!"

But I hadn't.

The problem for me was not so much that I did not have time. I had a lot of time back then, because I had a lot of problems with my boss, then. Not because he is a bad person, not because I would not like him. Sometimes, two people just talk past each other, no matter what they do, even if they try hard not to. I digress.

The problem was that TrakEM2 seemed too tedious to set up. It required a database, and not just any database. It had to be [http://www.postgresql.org/ PostgreSQL], back then probably the only popular database system I was <u>not</u> familiar with. TrakEM2 also required a bunch of ''.jar'' files which you had to install before you could start.

Eventually, Albert told me: "Johannes, we need an installer for TrakEM2!"

We kept chatting about that over a couple of weeks, if not months. At some stage, Albert had done away with the requirement of the PostgreSQL database. It was still the most efficient way to handle your data if you needed to access them from multiple computers, but now you could also store the intermediate data in plain files.

Eventually, one dark December day in 2007 (and in Scotland, December <u>is</u> as darkI as it gets) I gave in.

Out of frustration with my job, I had just started a distribution of [[Git]] for [http://msysgit.googlecode.com/ Windows] which included making an installer, so I thought I could put together an installer pretty quickly.

The first step was to get a version of ImageJ and TrakEM2 and Java (we were 100% sure that we needed to ship Java with the installer, otherwise users would get into problems with their Java 1.1.8 not being able to run Java 5 classes, let alone run at a decent speed) to run on the main platforms: Windows, MacOSX and Linux. You might not consider Linux a major platform, but it was and still is the platform Albert and me are using.

After a couple of days I showed the result to Albert. So far, there was no installer, but it was a working ''portable application'', i.e. a big ''.zip'' file you could unpack and then double click on an executable which would run Java with all the parameters set correctly.

To this date, there is no installer, but hey, maybe we get one in another 3 years...
