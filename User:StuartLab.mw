<h1>About Us</h1>
We are a research group at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ontario. The focus of our research is on the molecular mechanisms involved in aging and longevity. Mitochondria, via their contribution to energy metabolism, cell death pathways, and redox-regulated signal transduction pathways, are thought to be important effectors of longevity.  We use a comparative approach to study these in mammalian species, including those that are exceptionally long-lived.  We are also exploring the ability of small molecules including selective estrogen receptor modulators and phytoestrogens to modulate mitochondrial function and affect aging and longevity.
