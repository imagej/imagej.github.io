One of the most useful functions of ImageJ is the ''Command Launcher'' (also known as ''Command Finder''). The keyboard shortcut is {{key|Ctrl}}+{{key|L}} (or {{key|Command}}+{{key|L}} on Macs).

Once the window opens, just type part of the menu item you want to launch, and it will show you a list of commands that match that substring:

If you are not quite sure about the spelling, just click on the ''Fuzzy matching'' checkbox:

If you want to know what menu the entries are in, or from which .jar files they come, enable the ''full information'':
