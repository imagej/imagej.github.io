The script editor is an invaluable help when writing scripts in any of ImageJ's supported [[Scripting comparisons|languages]].

=== Starting the editor ===

To get started, start up the script editor:

There is also the keyboard shortcut {{key|{}} (open curly bracket) to open the editor.

=== Choosing a language ===

Then choose a language from the language menu:

Now you can write your script. In this tutorial, Jython was chosen as scripting language, but the process is really the same for all scripting languages.

=== Running the script ===

Once you are satisfied with the script, run it.  This does not require saving, but of course you should save your script later when it works.

Note that while the script is running, the window title shows the tell-tale ''(Running)''.

You can use all of ImageJ's classes right away.  Here is an example that shows a dialog where the user can input a number.
For details how to  write dialogs in the different scripting languages, see [[Scripting comparisons]]
