== What is the VisBio Plugin? ==
The VisBio Ortho Stack plugin is a simple 3D visualization plugin for Fiji that displays a stack of image planes in a parallel or perspective projection along the z plane. The plugin can control several common operations, such as specifying distance between cross sections, rotating and zooming the RD view, and saving a snapshot of the current image to a file. 

== Updating the VisBio Plugin ==
The VisBio Plugin is located within the LOCI updates. To learn more on how to update plugins, visit the update fiji page.
To update the VisBio Plugin: 
* Select ''Help>Update Fiji''
* Once the ImageJ Updater is presented, select "Manage Update sites"
* Select the "LOCI" site to update all LOCI plugins, including VisBio 
* Close "Manage Update Sites" and select "Apply changes"
* Restart ImageJ and the update will be in effect

== Using VisBio ==
To use VisBio you must first import an Image Sequence. To do so, Select ''File>Import>Image Sequence'' and select the file of images you wish to use.

 After you have your images imported, follow the following directions:
