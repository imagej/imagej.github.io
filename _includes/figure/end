</figure><!-- CTR START HERE: consider whether we really want to be using
  nested figures. If we could put the figcaptions in separate grid boxes,
  everything would line up a lot more easily. But because each figcaption is
  contained inside its panel figure, we need to resort to more involved CSS to
  align things vertically. Better to keep figure-col and figure-row variables,
  and do that bookkeeping, with grid-column and grid-row so we can stuff the
  captions
