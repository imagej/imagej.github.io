TrakEM2 has been updated to version 0.7d

Please call "Help - Update Fiji" to get the new TrakEM2\_.jar into your plugins folder.

The update includes:

  - fixes for "Area List" 3D mesh generation, particularly affecting calibrated projects.
  - fixes for "Profile List" for improved 3D mesh generation for non-closed profiles that represent 3D sheets.

The [TrakEM2 manual](http://t2.ini.uzh.ch/trakem2_manual.html) has been updated to explain details on new [automatic image registration](http://t2.ini.uzh.ch/trakem2_manual.html#registration) capabilities in versions 0.7, particularly its [image registration models](http://t2.ini.uzh.ch/trakem2_manual.html#registration_models).
