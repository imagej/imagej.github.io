[TrakEM2](TrakEM2 ) has been updated to version 0.7f

Please call "Help - Update Fiji" to get the new TrakEM2\_.jar into your plugins folder.

The update includes:

  - Fixes for AreaList mesh generation.
  - Fixes for blending overlapping images: images where width and height were different were failing to blend.
  - Fixes for creating new AreaList, new Pipe, etc: now correctly repainting the first area or point added.
  - Now {% include key content='Ctrl' %}+{% include key content='A' %} ({% include key content='Command' %}+{% include key content='A' %} in macosx) selects all but sensitive to object visibility and the presence of a ROI.
  - Now one must {% include key content='Shift' %}+{% include key content='click' %} the first point to get the Profile to close, or {% include key content='Shift' %}+{% include key content='C' %} any time to toggle the closed state.

Thanks to [German Koestinger](http://www.ini.uzh.ch/people/german) and {% include person content='Saalfeld' %} for testing and bug reports.
