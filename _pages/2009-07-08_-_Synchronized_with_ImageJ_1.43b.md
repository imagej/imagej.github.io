We [synchronized](https://fiji.sc/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=ImageJA.git;a=commitdiff;h=a7ba4674d615d8c31d53b617358d5aadc70008aa) our version of ImageJA with the upstream version ImageJ 1.43b. This finally allows compiling our version with OpenJDK, as ImageIO rather than Sun's proprietary API is used to read and write Jpeg images.
