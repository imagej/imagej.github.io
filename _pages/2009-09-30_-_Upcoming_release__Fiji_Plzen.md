A new release of Fiji is around the corner. If you want to test-drive it, please check out the [Release candidate](Downloads#Release_candidate ).

In our tradition to name releases after a city where we worked on the release, this release will be called *Fiji {% include wikipedia title='Plzeň' text='Plzeň'%}*.

The biggest news is certainly the new Fiji Updater, result of our second [Summer of Code](2009-03-18_-_Google_Summer_of_Code ) project. It is a well-needed improvement of the old updater, which did not even have a notion of what plugin requires which libraries. One of the most visible changes is that the updater will check upon startup whether there are new plugins/components available (you can choose never to check again, though).

Stay tuned for the full release notes\!
