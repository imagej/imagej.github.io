Thanks to the generous people at the [Biomedical Imaging Group of the EPFL](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/), we are now allowed to ship the [Extended Depth of Field](Extended_Depth_of_Field "wikilink") plugin with sources\!

The plugin is useful if you recorded a sample at different focal depths and you want to have a single two-dimensional image showing as much in-focus information as possible.

Merry Christmas\!
