Today we are releasing the third alpha of ImageJ2, version 2.0.0-alpha3. This is an "alpha"-quality release, meaning the code is not finished, nor is the design fully stabilized. We are releasing it for early community feedback, and to demonstrate project directions and progress.

DO NOT USE THIS RELEASE FOR ANYTHING IMPORTANT.

For this release, like [[2011-04-01 - ImageJ v2.0.0-alpha1|2.0.0-alpha1]] and [[2011-05-01 - ImageJ v2.0.0-alpha2|2.0.0-alpha2]], we have tried to model the application after ImageJ v1.x as much as is reasonable. However, please be aware that version 2.0.0 is essentially a total rewrite of ImageJ from the ground up. It provides backward compatibility with older versions of ImageJ by bundling the latest v1.x code and translating between "legacy" and "modern" image structures.

The most significant advancement for 2.0.0-alpha3 is partial support for regions of interest (ROIs), via the [http://www.randelshofer.ch/oop/jhotdraw/index.html JHotDraw] library. It is now possible to draw rectangles, ellipses and polygons in an ImageJ2 display.

We have also improved the legacy layer so that many ImageJ1 plugins work better, although it is still far from perfect. There is partial support for preserving both ROIs and color lookup tables (LUTs) between IJ1 and IJ2 plugin executions, meaning that you can draw a ROI and then execute an IJ1 plugin, and it will operate on only the pixels within the ROI.

For further details on the release, see the <code>README.txt</code> file included with the distribution.
