The Script Editor knows how to handle ImageJ Macros for some time now, and it was also able to open the documentation of the builtin functions on the [ImageJ website](https://imagej.net/developer/macro/functions.html) using the {% include bc content='Tools | Open Help on Macro Functions...'%} menu entry. As of the current Script Editor version, if you select the name of a builtin function, that menu entry will lead you to the documentation of said function straight away.
