Thanks to [Jarek Sacha](http://ij-plugins.sourceforge.net/), our [Fiji Updater](Fiji_Updater "wikilink") now has support for SFTP in addition to SSH. Many sites do not allow for direct SSH access but only for SFTP, like [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net). Now we support such sites, too\!

To enable SFTP support, just prefix *sftp:* in front of the SSH host in the [update site configuration](Adding_Update_Sites "wikilink").
