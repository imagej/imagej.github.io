[[TrakEM2]] started in 2005 when {{Person|Albertcardona}} worked for the whole Summer with [http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~rjd/ Rodney J. Douglas] at the Institute of Neuroinformatics in Zurich, Switzerland, to establish an ImageJ-based program to aid in the reconstruction of neural circuits from large image volumes.

In its path, TrakEM2 fostered the development of software libraries for image registration, leading to the extraordinary work of [http://fly.mpi-cbg.de/saalfeld Stephan Saalfeld] and [http://fly.mpi-cbg.de/preibisch Stephan Preibisch] at the lab of [http://www.mpi-cbg.de/research/research-groups/pavel-tomancak.html Pavel Tomancak] at MPI-CBG, Dresden. Albert Cardona's work on TraKEM2 contributed to the VIB libraries by Johannes Schindelin, Bene Schmid and Mark Longair, and in particular to the development of the [[3D Viewer]]<ref>{{cite journal|author=Benjamin Schmid , Johannes Schindelin , Albert Cardona , Mark Longair  and Martin Heisenberg|title=A high-level 3D visualization API for Java and ImageJ|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|year=2010|volume=11|page=274|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/274/abstract}}</ref> for the rendering of meshes and skeletons in 3D. The [[:Category:Scripting|scripting]] utilities now present in Fiji, and Fiji itself, spinned off from work in or related to TrakEM2.

[[TrakEM2]] has now reached [http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~acardona/trakem2.html version 1.0] and is feature complete.
