[ImgLib2](ImgLib2 "wikilink") was published in [Bioinformatics](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/22/3009). The library developed jointly by Stephan Saalfeld, Stephan Preibisch and Tobias Pietszch has originated in Fiji, but has outgrown it becoming the centerpiece of other projects, especially [ImageJ2](ImageJ2 "wikilink"). Pavel Tomancak provided funding for its developers.\[1\].
