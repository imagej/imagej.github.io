Today, the [ImageJ team](Contributors ) is pleased to announce the first official support for running ImageJ in Docker: Fiji images\!

# Motivation

If you aren't already familiar with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), it provides a flexible mechanism for distributing operating system + application state.

For ImageJ, this means a way to guarantee scientific [reproducibility](reproducibility ) across all the variables of software use: not just installed plugins and update sites, but Java versions, system tools, environment variables, and even OS version.

It also should help provide new paradigms for lifeline distributions and minimization of dependencies/prerequisites.

# Docker images

For now, the first Docker images are Fiji distributions with various Java versions. See:

  - [Fiji on Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/fiji/fiji/)
  - [Fiji Dockerfiles](https://github.com/fiji/dockerfiles)
  - [Instructions for use](Docker )

Please note that Docker use of Fiji is still highly experimental, but any feedback and contributions would be welcome\!
