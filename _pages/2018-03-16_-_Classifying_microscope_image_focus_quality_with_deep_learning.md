The Google Accelerated Science team has published an ImageJ plugin, [Microscope Focus Quality](Microscope_Focus_Quality ), for assessing the focus quality of microscope images using a pretrained [TensorFlow](TensorFlow ) model.

{% include thumbnail src='/images/pages/Mifqc.png ' title=' 400px \| The Microscope Focus Quality plugin classifies image tiles into 11 classes (hue) with varying confidence (brightness).'%}

For details, see the Google Research Blog post [Using Deep Learning to Facilitate Scientific Image Analysis](https://research.googleblog.com/2018/03/using-deep-learning-to-facilitate.html), as well as the publication in BMC Bioinformatics:
