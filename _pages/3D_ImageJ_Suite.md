3D ImageJ Suite
---------------

This *suite* provides plugins to enhance 3D capabilities of ImageJ.

Migrating contents from [3D Suite on ImageJ Documentation Website](https://imagejdocu.list.lu/plugin/stacks/3d_ij_suite/start).

The pdf of the [NEUBIAS academy](http://eubias.org/NEUBIAS/training-schools/neubias-academy-home/) presentation "*Introduction to 3D Analysis with 3D ImageJ suite*" is available : [NEUBIAS\_3DSuite.pdf](/media/NEUBIAS 3DSuite.pdf).

The associated video is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPC2kP-5By4). The QAs are available on the [image.sc forum](https://forum.image.sc/t/neubias-academy-home-webinar-introduction-to-3d-analysis-with-3d-imagej-suite-questions-answers/39027).

The associated project for automation is available in [TAPAS](/plugins/tapas).

Features
--------

This *suite* is composed of :

-   [3D Filters](3D_Filters) (mean, median, max, min, tophat, max local, ...) and [Edge and symmetry filter](/plugins/edge-and-symmetry-filter)
-   [3D Segmentation](3D_Segmentation) (iterative thresholding, spots segmentation, watershed, ...)
-   [3D Mathematical Morphology](3D_Mathematical_Morphology) tools (fill holes, binary closing, distance map, ...)
-   [3D RoiManager](https://imagejdocu.list.lu/plugin/stacks/3d_roi_manager/start) (3D display and analysis of 3D objects)
-   [3D Analysis](https://imagejdocu.list.lu/plugin/analysis/3d_analysis/start) (Geometrical measurements, Mesh measurements, Convex hull, ...)
-   [3D MereoTopology](https://imagejdocu.list.lu/plugin/analysis/3d_mereotopology/start) (Relationship between objects)
-   [3D Tools](https://imagejdocu.list.lu/plugin/stacks/3d_tools:start) (Drawing ellipsoids and lines, cropping, ...)

A 2D/3D [spatial statistics](https://imagejdocu.list.lu/plugin/analysis/spatial_statistics_2d_3d/start) plugin is also available.

Installation
------------

From version 2.7, **3D ImageJ Suite** is available in Fiji as an [Fiji update site](http://fiji.sc/List_of_update_sites). The **Java8** and **ImageScience** update sites must be activated in Fiji, see instructions [here](https://imagej.net/Following_an_update_site)\].

You can also install **3D ImageJ Suite** manually (see download section) and unzip it in your plugins folder. The various plugins will appear in the menu **3D** of the plugins list.

You have also to manually download and copy into your plugins directory the **imagescience.jar** library from [here](http://www.imagescience.org/meijering/software/featurej/).

Download
--------

ImageJ 1.47 or later is required. Java3D is also required, check that [3D\_Viewer](/plugins/3d-viewer) is working.

**NEW** From version 3.83 and later, for ImageJ users the new version 4.0.1 of 3D\_Viewer is required (please remove the 3D\_Viewer plugin provided by ImageJ and replace it by [3d\_viewer-mcib.zip](/media/3d viewer-mcib.zip), just unzip the file in the plugins directory).

Java 1.8 or later is required. '''The [imagescience](http://www.imagescience.org/meijering/software/featurej/) library is required ''' : [download here](http://www.imagescience.org/meijering/software/download/imagescience.jar).

**Bundle** : [Mcib3d-suite3.96.3.zip](/media/Mcib3d-suite3.96.3.zip)
