{{ComponentStats:sc.fiji:3D_Objects_Counter}}
== What does it do ? ==
This plugin:
*'''counts the number of 3D objects in a stack.'''
*'''quantifies for each found object the following parameters:'''
**Integrated density;
**Mean of the gray values;
**Standard deviation of the gray values;
**Minimum gray value;
**Maximum gray value;
**Median of the gray values;
**Mean distance from the geometrical centre of the object to surface;
**Standard deviation of the distance to surface;
**Median distance to surface;
**Centroid;
**Centre of mass;
**Bounding box.
*'''generates results representations such as:'''
**Objects' map;
**Surface voxels' map;
**Centroids' map;
**Centres of masses' map.

As ImageJ's “Analyze Particles” function, 3D-OC also has a “redirect to” option, allowing one image to be taken as a mask to quantify intensity related parameters on a second image.
