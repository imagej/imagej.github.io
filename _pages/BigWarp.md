{% include component-stats content=':sc.fiji:bigwarp\_fiji' %}Bigwarp is a tool for manual, interactive, landmark-based deformable image alignment. It uses the [BigDataViewer](BigDataViewer "wikilink") for visualization and navigation, and uses a {% include wikipedia title='Thin\_plate\_spline' text='Thin Plate Spline'%} implemented {% include github org='saalfeldlab ' repo='bigwarp ' label='in Java ' %} to build a deformation from point correspondences.

The interface enables landmark pair placement and displays the effects of the warp on-the-fly.

## Installation

Bigwarp comes with Fiji. You can access it via *Plugins {% include arrow%}
 BigDataViewer {% include arrow%}
 Big Warp*, or by modifying {% include github org='saalfeldlab ' repo='bigwarp ' path='scripts/bigwarp\_fiji\_demo.bsh ' label='this example script ' %}. If this is not visible in your installation, try updating Fiji with *Help {% include arrow%}
 Update Fiji.*

## Usage

Open two images in ImageJ, one *moving* and the other *target* and navigate to *Plugins {% include arrow%}
 BigDataViewer {% include arrow%}
 Big Warp.* A dialog will appear prompting selection of the moving and target images.

Once the two image windows and one table window open, press {% include key content='press|Spacebar' %} to enter "landmark mode". Next, click on a point in the moving image, then click on the corresponding point in the target image. After you have a few moving-target point pairs, press {% include key content='press|T' %} to transform the moving image (you may need to re-navigate if the two image are very far apart: see the {% include key content='press|Q' %} and {% include key content='press|W' %} hotkeys below).

### Getting Help

Press {% include key content='press|F1' %} at any time to open a help page with a listing of navigation and editing commands. For detailed help, create a post on the [image.sc forum](https://forum.image.sc/) with a bigwarp tag. Report bugs [on github](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/bigwarp/issues).

### Landmark point placement and display in the viewer

Landmark placements is done in *Landmark mode* which you enter by pressing {% include key content='press|Spacebar' %}. Users place pairs of corresponding points on the moving and target images.

The following table shows the available commands and keystrokes for landmark placement, warping.

### Landmark selection and editing in the table

Some changes to landmarks can be done by interacting with the landmark table.

|                                                                                      |                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| {% include key content='press|left-click' %}                                         | Select row.                                             |
| {% include key content='press|Ctrl' %}+{% include key content='press|left-click' %}  | Add row to selection.                                   |
| {% include key content='press|Shift' %}+{% include key content='press|left-click' %} | Select range of rows.                                   |
| {% include key content='press|Esc' %}                                                | Deselect all rows.                                      |
| {% include key content='press|right-click' %} {% include arrow%}
 Delete                   | Deletes a landmark pair (row in the table).             |
| {% include key content='press|right-click' %} {% include arrow%}
 Delete all selected      | Deletes all selected landmark pairs (row in the table). |

### Notes on point addition and landmark pair selection

  - Adding a new landmark pair selects that pair (row) in the table.
  - If a row is "missing" a moving (target) landmark point, then it must be selected in order to add that missing point by clicking in the moving (target) viewer. Then BigWarp will find the "next" row that is missing a moving (target) landmark, and select that row automatically.
  - If the selected row is not missing a landmark, the next click will add a new landmark pair.
  - If multiple rows are selected when a viewer is clicked, the result will be as though only the first row was selected.

### Selecting transformation types

Press {% include key content='press|F8' %} to bring up a transformation type selection window (version 4.0.0 of BigWarp supports multiple options for transformations)

### Navigation and Visualization

Bigwarp inherits many image [navigation](BigDataViewer#Basic_Navigation "wikilink"), [visualization](BigDataViewer#Adjusting_Brightness_and_Color "wikilink"), and [grouping](BigDataViewer#Grouping_Sources "wikilink") features with BigDataViewer, the details of which can be found on the [BigDataViewer](BigDataViewer "wikilink") page or on the help page. BigWarp specific features are documented below.

The following table shows the available navigation commands using the mouse:

| {% include key content='press|Shift|Z' %}                                                                     | Rotate to the XY-plane of the current source. (Look along the Z-axis of the current source.) |

For all navigation commands you can hold {% include key content='press|Shift' %} to rotate and browse 10x faster, or hold {% include key content='press|Ctrl' %} to rotate and browse 10x slower. For example, {% include key content='press|Left' %} rotates by 1° clockwise, while {% include key content='press|Shift|Left' %} rotates by 10°, and {% include key content='press|Ctrl|Left' %} rotates by 0.1°.

### Save and load landmarks

Landmarks can be exported and imported from plain text files using the drop down menu in the landmark table panel ( *File {% include arrow%}
 Export (Import) landmarks.* )

### Export warped images

Export the warped moving image by clicking *File {% include arrow%}
 \> Export as ImagePlus* or using the {% include key content='press|Ctrl' %}+{% include key content='press|E' %} keyboard shortcut.

The default parameters will result in the exported image having the same dimensions as the target image. *Note: Take care when exporting very large data sets as they can cause out-of-memory exceptions.*

  - Resolution
      - Target: *The output will have the same resolution as the target image*
      - Moving: *The output will have the same resolution as the moving image*
      - Specified: *The output will have the resolution given in the fields below (in the same units as the moving and target images).*

<!-- end list -->

  - Field of view
      - Target: *The output will have the same field of view as the target image*
      - Moving: *The output field of view will be the smallest bounding box that contains the warped moving images (approximated)*
      - Specified (pixel): '' The output field of view will be that given by the Offset and Field of View parameter fields where both are in units of pixels''\*\* \*\* Specified (physical): '' The output field of view will be that given by the Offset and Field of View parameter fields where both are in the physical units of the moving and target images''

The warped moving image can be exported as an in-memory or [virtual](https://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-8.html) ImagePlus. A virtual ImagePlus is generally faster to generate but slower to browse, whereas an in-memory ImagePlus will be slower to generate but faster to browse.

### Apply transforms

Often, it is important to apply transforms estimated with one image to other images in the same space.

If you have moving and target images open in Fiji [this script](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/bigwarp/blob/master/scripts/Apply_Bigwarp_Xfm.groovy) to transform the moving image into the space of the target image. You will need to provide a file containing the saved landmark point pairs.

To manually specify the field-of-view (FOV) of the target space, use [this script](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/bigwarp/blob/master/scripts/Apply_Bigwarp_Xfm_FOV.groovy)

To make the scripts above appear in your Fiji Plugins menu, simply copy them into the `/plugins/Scripts folder` in your Fiji installation.

#### Warp 2d ImageJ ROIs

Download and install [this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saalfeldlab/bigwarp/master/scripts/Apply_Bigwarp_Xfm_IjRoi2d.groovy).

Usage:

1.  Run the script downloadable above.
2.  Indicate which open images correspond to the moving and fixed images in bigwarp.
3.  Select the csv file that stores bigwarp landmarks.
4.  Indicate whether you want to transform an ROI from moving to target space or vice versa.
5.  Click OK.

Note that the resulting ROI will be densely sampled. This is because an ROI with a particular shape may not have the same shape after being warped (i.e., a circle may not still be circular after being warped).

Example: In this example, we've chosen the boats sample as the moving image, the bridge sample as the target image, and have added some landmarks that transform the boats image.

To warp an ROI from the moving boats image to the fixed bridge image, we run the script with the options:

>   - Fixed image: boats
>   - Moving image: bridge
>   - Landmark file: <our landmarks file>
>   - Moving to target

The results are shown in the "Forward example" below.

To warp an ROI from the moving boats image to the fixed bridge image, we run the script with the options:

>   - Fixed image: boats
>   - Moving image: bridge
>   - Landmark file: <our landmarks file>
>   - Target to moving

The results are shown in the "Inverse example" below.

|                                                   |                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| <img src="/images/pages/Bigwarp warp roi fwd.png" width="600"/> | <img src="/images/pages/Bigwarp warp roi inv.png" width="600"/> |
| Forward example (click to expand)                 | Inverse example (click to expand)                 |

Note, at this time ImageJ ROIs are 2D objects. We recommend using another approach for 3D regions of interest.

#### Warp points in a csv file

Download and install [this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saalfeldlab/bigwarp/master/scripts/Apply_Bigwarp_Xfm_csvPts.groovy).

Usage:

1.  Run the script download-able above.
2.  Select the csv file that stores bigwarp landmarks.
3.  Select the csv file storing the points you want to transform.
4.  Select the location for csv file you want the results to be stored in.
5.  Indicate whether you want to transform the points from moving to target space or vice versa.
6.  Click OK.

Note the input csv must be formatted:

` x1,y1,z1`  
` x2,y2,z2`  
` ...`  
` xN,yN,zN`

without quotation marks, spaces, or any other characters. Csv files storing bigwarp landmarks will not work as input to this script.

## Working with large images

The "normal" BigWarp plugin accessible through *Plugins {% include arrow%}
 Big Data Viewer {% include arrow%}
 BigWarp* works well for small- and medium-sized images but not for very large volumes (that do not fit into memory). For very large volumes, we recommend first [converting the volume to bigdataviewer's xml/hdf5 format](https://imagej.net/BigDataViewer#Exporting_Datasets_for_the_BigDataViewer), then using [this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saalfeldlab/bigwarp/master/scripts/BigWarp_ImagePlus_or_Xml.groovy) to run BigWarp using the xml/h5 file(s). See also [this forum post.](https://forum.image.sc/t/issue-with-big-warp/31472)

[This script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saalfeldlab/bigwarp/master/scripts/BigWarp_N5.groovy) enables you to run BigWarp using images stored using [N5](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5).
