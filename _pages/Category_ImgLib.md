The [[Imglib]] is a library whose purpose is to relieve developers from having to implement their algorithm individually for different data types, dimensionalities or storage strategies (e.g. a VirtualStack would be a different storage strategy from the regular ImageStack).

By a clever encapsulation strategy, it works around performance limitations of Java generics.
