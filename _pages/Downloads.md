Here you can [download](https://downloads.imagej.net/ImageJ2-20160205.zip) an "all platforms" version of ImageJ, without a bundled Java or extra extensions.

{% include info-box content='Unfortunately, due to the ongoing transition from Java 6 to Java 8, this download of "plain ImageJ2" cannot currently be updated to the latest Java-8-compatible version. See the [Java 8](/news/2016-05-10_-_ImageJ_HOWTO_-_Java_8,_Java_6,_Java_3D) page for details. For the time being, we recommend [using the Fiji distribution of ImageJ](Fiji/Downloads) to stay current with updates.' %}
