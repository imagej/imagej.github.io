This page provides an introduction on how to start using the [http://www.eclipse.org/egit/ EGit] extension in the [[Eclipse]] IDE for software development.

== Installing EGit in Eclipse ==

In the newer versions of Eclipse, the EGit extension comes already preinstalled. If this should not be so in your case you can install it as follows:
# in Eclipse go to {{bc|Help |Install New Software...}}
# you can look in the "All Available Sites" drop down panel if EGit is existing there or add update site with the {{key|Add..}} button
# enter this URI: <nowiki>http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates</nowiki>
# choose the ''JGit'' and the ''Eclipse Team Provider'' and {{key|Finish}} the installation

== Setting up EGit panels in Eclipse ==
To have the EGit panes available you might need to set the following up:
# go to {{bc|Window |Show View | Others...}} and select under {{bc||Git}} at least ''Git Repositories'' and ''Git Staging''
## additionally, it is helpful to add under {{bc||Team}} ''History''

Here you can also find a video tutorial on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptK9-CNms98 integrating github with Eclipse] including already an intro on how to clone a public github repository (see below).

== Cloning an existing git repository ==
# go to github into the repository you wish to clone and copy the URI
# switch to the Git repository panel in Eclipse
# ''Clone a Git Repository'' button (in the window which opens up the copied URI should be already specified. If not, change this here)
# hit {{key|Next >}} and select the branch(es) you would like to clone (then hit {{key|Next >}})
# specify where all your local git repositories sould be stored and press {{key|Finish}}
# once the cloned repository is visible in the ''Git Repositories'' panel, you can right click on it and choose ''Import Projects...''
## choose ''Import as general project'' and press {{key|Next >}}
## specify the projects name and {{key|Next >}}

If the clones repository contains a [[Maven]] project, you can then right-click it in Eclipses' package explorer and choose {{bc|Configure |Convert to Maven Project}}

Et voila, ready and all in Eclipse. 

== Video tutorials on EGit usage ==
Furthermore, you will find helpful how-to info for branching, staging, committing, pull- and push actions and merging repos in the following videos:

Surely, command line is for many things more flexible with all the attributes you can use for the commands, but it is easier for the beginning if starting without commandline experience.

Here is a neat (commandline related) interactive page which exlains the different [http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html levels of working with git repositories]

== UI alternatives to EGit ==
Here alternative user interface based git-related tools are listed.
