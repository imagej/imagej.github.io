{{Template:Outdated}}

The hierarchy of the Fiji's Menu is shown here, with a few words of explanation for each menu entry and links to more documentation where available.  If you know about a menu entry that is in this list, but which doesn't yet have a description, please add it.  

This list is generated automatically from a {{GitHub|repo=fiji|path=bin/plugin-list-parser.py|label=script}} that can be found in the development folder. It is stored in [[Template:PluginList|this template]].
