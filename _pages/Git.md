Development of ImageJ and related software relies heavily on [Git](http://git-scm.com/). See the [source code](/develop/source) page for information on where the Git repositories reside.

Why do we use Git?
------------------

-   Git is a first-class {% include wikipedia title='Distributed version control' text='distributed'%} {% include wikipedia title='Version control' text='version control'%} system, so we use it to keep a record of changes to avoid loss-of-work and to appropriately explain/document changes as projects develop.
-   Git history, which is composed of "snapshots" of the source code, can be used to go back at any point in time, which leads to reproducible science.

Rewriting history
-----------------

One of the most powerful things Git can do is rewrite a series of patches after the fact. This is a powerful technique worth learning. There are many guides available here and elsewhere:



* [Modifying your commits](How_to_contribute_to_an_existing_plugin_or_library#Modifying_your_commits) section of the [Contributing to a plugin](/develop/improving-the-code) page
*   [Advanced topic branch editing](Git_topic_branches#Advanced_topic_branch_editing_.28AKA_rebase_on_drugs.29) section of the [Git topic branches](/develop/git/topic-branches) tutorial
*   [Rewriting history](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/) tutorial from Atlassian
*   [7.6 Git Tools - Rewriting History](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History) from the Git book
*   [About Git rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/) article from GitHub
