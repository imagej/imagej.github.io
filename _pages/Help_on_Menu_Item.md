The convenient command {% include bc path='Help | Help on Menu Item'%} allows you to open pages on specific menu items:

![](/media/help-on-menu-item.png "Help-On-Menu-Item.png")

The mouse cursor will change to an arrow with a question mark and the next menu item on which you click will not execute that command but open the page on this Wiki that corresponds to the selected command.
