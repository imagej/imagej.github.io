{{DevelopMenu | tools}}An [[wikipedia:Integrated development environment|integrated development environment]] (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger. Most modern IDEs offer intelligent code completion features.

[[ImageJ]] can be developed using any IDE which supports [[Maven]], which includes:

== Why use an IDE? ==

There are many advantages of using an IDE for software development:

# It is easy to access documentation about classes (i.e. [[javadoc]]): just point your cursor over the name of the class, or press the keyboard shortcut (e.g., in Eclipse: {{key|Shift|F2}}).
# You can use code completion: just type the start of the class name, variable, method, etc you want to use and hit the keyboard shortcut (e.g., in Eclipse: {{key|Ctrl|Space}}).
# Compile errors are listed in a concise list; double-clicking on a line in that list will move the cursor to the problem.
# You can [[Debugging Exercises|debug your program interactively]]: just open the main class (i.e. a class having a <code>public static void main(String[] args)</code> method) and launch it in debug mode. E.g., in Eclipse: go to {{bc|Run|Debug As|Java Application}}). This will switch to a different window layout (the ''Debug perspective'') which offers you a range of views that are useful for debugging such as: local variables, thread stack traces, etc. You can interrupt the program at any time by clicking on the ''pause'' symbol and inspect the current state, single-step through the code and even to a limited amount replace code on-the-fly.
# The most important version control systems can be accessed easily through the IDE's GUI.
# There are many awesome keyboard shortcuts, especially effective to quickly explore large projects. (see e.g. [[Eclipse#Keyboard_shortcuts|keyboard shortcuts for Eclipse]]).
# They can be enhanced with plugins. E.g., for Eclipse, the [http://vrapper.sourceforge.net/ Vrapper plugin] adds a vim-like input scheme.

The main disadvantage of modern IDEs is that they are quite large and require a lot of resources—RAM and screen size in particular.
