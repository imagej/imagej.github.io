## Presentation

*KymographBuilder is Yet Another Kymograph Fiji plugin.*

Features are :

  - Build kymograph from a straight or segmented line (a polyline).
  - Build kymograph for images with multiple channels.
  - Take into account the width of the line using maximum projection along its thickness.
  - Built from scratch and use the ImageJ2 Ecosystem.
  - Fast and easy to use.

How to use :

  - Draw a line: it can be a polyline and you can also set the thickness that will be taken into account by the plugin.
  - Launch KymographBuilder : {% include bc content='Plugins|Kymograph|KymographBuilder'%}
  - You're done.
