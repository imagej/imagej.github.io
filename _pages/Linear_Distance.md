Plugin for ImageJ to measure linear distances in images in X and Y direction. At this time, two methods are implemented: First, the automatic scan of a binarized, two phased image. Second, the interactive placement of marks which will be measured afterwards (Linear Interception).

More information on github.

For automatic installation in Fiji, add update site SimonKlein.
