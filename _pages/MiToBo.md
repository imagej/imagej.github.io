MiToBo is an extension of [ImageJ](ImageJ ), i.e. MiToBo operators are ready to be directly used as plugins in ImageJ.

To make use of MiToBo's functionality it can be enabled by [toggling the MiToBo update site](Update_Sites ).

For further details, see the [MiToBo website](http://www.informatik.uni-halle.de/mitobo/).

MiToBo is based on the [Alida](Alida ) framework. MiToBo's operators are managed by Alida's graphical operator runner. In addition, and thanks to Alida's built-in graphical workflow editor *Grappa* also image analysis workflows can easily be designed graphically.
