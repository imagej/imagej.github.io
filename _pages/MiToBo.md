}}The Microscope Image Analysis Toolbox MiToBo is a collection of basic and advanced image processing operators and applications mainly dedicated to biological and biomedical image data, however, not restricted to these fields. MiToBo is an extension of [[ImageJ]], i.e. MiToBo operators are ready to be directly used as plugins in ImageJ. 

To make use of MiToBo's functionality it can be enabled by [[Update Sites|toggling the MiToBo update site]].

For further details, see the [http://www.informatik.uni-halle.de/mitobo/ MiToBo website].

MiToBo is based on the [[Alida]] framework. MiToBo's operators are managed by Alida's graphical operator runner. In addition, and thanks to Alida's built-in graphical workflow editor ''Grappa'' also image analysis workflows can easily be designed graphically.
