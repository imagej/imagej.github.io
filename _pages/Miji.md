{% include info-box content='This page covers the original compatibility layer for running ImageJ 1.x within MATLAB.  
The current library for ImageJ/MATLAB integration is [ImageJ-MATLAB](/scripting/matlab); it has many advantages over this legacy project.' %}

[MIJ](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/sage/soft/mij/) is a java package to exchange images between [MATLAB](MATLAB) and ImageJ. It is written by {% include person content='Sage' %} (Biomedical Image Group (BIG), Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland) and {% include person content='Dimiterpp' %} (Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Université Catholique de Louvain (UCL), Brussels, Belgium). It allows to start a instance of ImageJ inside [MATLAB](MATLAB) and exchange images back and forth with it. It takes advantage of the fact that the user interface of [MATLAB](MATLAB) is written in Java.

For your convenience, Jacques Pecreaux & {% include person content='Schindelin' %} wrote Miji.m, which makes it super-easy to use Fiji and the libraries and functions provided by [Fiji](/fiji)'s components from within [MATLAB](MATLAB). Simply make sure that the *scripts/* directory of your *Fiji.app/* is in [MATLAB](MATLAB)'s search patch, via {% include bc content='File | Set Path...'%} (on Mac, the file chooser doesn't let you choose directories within .app packages, so you have to use the [MATLAB](MATLAB) command *addpath('/Applications/Fiji.app/scripts')* ). Then a simple

    Miji;

will start a Fiji inside [MATLAB](MATLAB).

{% include warning-box message='There are over 300 jar and plugin files that ship with Fiji, and depending on your operating system and configuration, you may run into **too many files open** errors (for example, on OSX [MATLAB](MATLAB) seems to use the default soft limit for open files, which is typically 256). If this happens you will need to increase the open file limit per-session or system-wide. See [this guide](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/tuning/open-files-limit/) for helpful instructions on doing so for OSX and Linux.' %}

Getting started
===============

Using MATLAB as processing core and sending results to Fiji
-----------------------------------------------------------

An example how to work with MIJ is provided here:

    MIJ.run('Embryos (42K)');
    I = MIJ.getCurrentImage;
    E = imadjust(wiener2(im2double(I(:,:,1))));
    imshow(E);
    MIJ.createImage('result', E, true);

If you get an error saying that some Plugin related classes cannot be found, please update your Fiji with {% include bc content='Help | Update Fiji'%}!

Running ImageJ commands
-----------------------

In ImageJ, you can \[http://mirror.imagej.net/docs/guide/146-31.html#sub:Record... record macros\], one of the most powerful ways to use the program. Most of the recorded statements will look like this:

    run("Command", "key1=7 key2 key3=[C:\\Documents and Settings\\Fiji\\Test.png]");

The first parameter to the *run()* method is the menu item's label which identifies the plugin to run (in this example, the label would read: *Command*).

The second parameter is a String containing values the user specified via an [ImageJ dialog](http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/ImageJ1-javadoc/javadoc/ij/gui/GenericDialog.html). Every value is identified by a label, and except for checkboxes (such as *key2* in the example above), they have values. If the values contain spaces, you need to enclose the value in square brackets (such as *key3* in the example above).

Note that the backslash is a so-called *escape character*, i.e. it can be used to insert special characters such as line breaks or tabs. To insert a plain backslash, it has to be repeated therefore (as in the *key3* value: **C:\\Documents and Settings** becomes **"C:\\\\Documents and Settings"**).

You can use those recorded statements in a slightly modified form via MIJ:

1.  replace the double quotes by single quotes
2.  prefix the *run* name with *MIJ.*

The above example would read like this:

    MIJ.run('Command', 'key1=7 key2 key3=[C:\\Documents and Settings\\Fiji\\Test.png]');

Note: in [MATLAB](MATLAB), it is not strictly necessary to end the *MIJ.run()* statement with a semicolon, because it does not return anything. However, it is good practice with MIJ to end all statements in semicolons: some functions return images, cluttering the output and taking a very long time to print if the statement does not end in a semicolon.

Opening images
--------------

Normally, the best way to use MIJ is to [use ImageJ's macro recorder](#Running_ImageJ_commands "wikilink"). However, this procedure does not work when opening images because ImageJ records simply: **open("/path/to/image.png");**

Instead, one needs to keep in mind how *run()* statements are constructed and imitate it for the *Open...* command:

    MIJ.run('Open...', 'path=[C:\\Documents and Settings\\Fiji\\Test.png]');

Using Fiji as a 3D viewer for MATLAB
------------------------------------

A set of demos made for [MATLAB](MATLAB) users, and introducing how to install and use Fiji as a visualization tool for [MATLAB](MATLAB) is published on the [fex](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/32344-hardware-accelerated-3d-viewer-for-matlab).

Getting help
============

To get a quick help on the available functions, call

    MIJ.help

Further descriptions and example code can be found on [the home page for MIJ](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/sage/soft/mij/). Eventually, detailed documentation about the class MIJ can be found [here](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/sage/soft/mij/doc/index.html) (suitable if you have a bit of experience with Java).

Alternative: do not start the Fiji GUI
======================================

If you want to use the functions without starting Fiji's graphical interface, just call

    Miji(false);
