== Purpose ==
A 3D version of the minimum, maximum and median filter.

== Description ==
Each voxel is set to the minimum, maximum or median value of its
neighborhood.

The neighborhood is defined by a kernel, which has a diameter of 3 voxels.

The image below shows the effect of each of the filters, using the MRI sample image
which comes with ImageJ and Fiji.
