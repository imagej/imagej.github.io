# General Description

The ImageJ Shape Filter Plugin use the [\[ij-blob](https://github.com/thorstenwagner/ij-blob)\] library to characterize and filter objects in binary scenes by its shape. Therefore, several features are calculated as shown below. ![Shape\_Filter\_GUI.png](/images/pages/Shape Filter GUI.png "Shape_Filter_GUI.png")

## Shape Features

  - **Area** (\(A\)): The area enclosed by the outer contour of an object.
  - **Area Convex Hull** (\(C\)): The area enclosed by the convex hull of the outer contour of an object.
  - **Perimeter** (\(P\)): The perimeter of the outer contour of an object.
  - **Perimeter Convex Hull** (\(H\)): The perimeter of the convex hull of the particle.
  - **Feret Diameter**: The maximum distance between the two parallel tangents touching the particle outline in all directions.
  - **Min. Feret Diameter**: the minimum distance between the two parallel tangents touching the particle outline in all directions.
  - **Max. Inscr. Circle Diameter**: The diameter of the maximum inscribed circle.
  - **Area eq. circle diameter**: Equivalent circle diameter \(2\sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}}\)
  - **Long Side Minimum Bounding Rectangle** (\(L\)): The larger side of the minimum bounding rectangle.
  - **Short Side Minimum Bounding Rectangle** (\(S\)): The smaller side of the minimum bounding rectangle.
  - **Aspect Ratio**: Defined as \(L/S\)
  - **Area to Perimeter Ratio**: Defined as \(A/P\)
  - **Circularity**: Defined as \(P^{2}/A\)
  - **Elongation**: Defined as \(1 - S/L\)
  - **Convexity**: Defined as \(H/P\)
  - **Solidity**: Defined as \(A/C\)
  - **Number of Holes**: The number of holes inside an object.
  - **Thinnes Ratio**: Inverse proportional to the circularity. Furthermore it normed. It is defined as \(4\pi A/P^{2}\)
  - **Contour Temperatur**: It has a strong relationship to the fractal dimension, defined as \(\left(log_{2}\left(\frac{2P}{P-H}\right)\right)^{-1}\)
  - **Orientation**: The orientation of the major axis from in grad (measured counter clockwise from the positive x axis).
  - **Fractal Box Dimension**: Estimated fractal dimension by the box count algorithm. The default box-sizes are “2,3,4,6,8,12,16,32,64”.
