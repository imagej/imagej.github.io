{{ComponentStats:sc.fiji:Stack_Manipulation}}
== Content and purpose ==

This package regroups various "small" plugins dedicated to the manipulation of stacks, allowing to sort them, combine them, etc...
As they are more of a utility package, they all can be found in the {{bc | Image | Stacks | Tools}} menu, next to the ones provided by bare ImageJ.

What they do is pretty much summarized by the following diagram, taken from the [[MBF ImageJ]] webpage.

* The '''Grouped ZProjector''' acts a bit like the '''Substack Maker''', for it allows to reduce the number of frame within a stack. But rather than taking a slice every certain step, it combines a group of slices and project them on a single slice. The size of the groups is configurable, and must be a divisor of the total number of slice.


* The '''Slice Keeper''' does the opposite that of '''Slice Remover'''. Instead of removing every nth slice in a stack, it creates a new stack by only keeping every nth slice from the original stack.

=== Slice Remover ===

This command lets you remove multiple slices in one go. You can specify a start slice, and end slice and an increment (i.e. start=1, end=5, increment=2 will remove the slices 1, 3 and 5). Warning: The Slice Remover treats hyperstacks as if they were converted via {{bc | Image | Hyperstacks | Hyperstack to Stack}} first.

Original code by {{Person|Rasband}}.

=== Slice Keeper ===

By Tony Collins, initially part of his wonderful [[MBF Plugin Collection]] package. Tony mentioned credit should go to {{Person|Rasband}}, for the initial code is his work.
