== The Hue Game ==

This game is based on an online demonstration of [http://www.xrite.com/custom_page.aspx?PageID=77&Lang=en xrite.com] and is included in Fiji to demonstrate a couple of things:

* Humans' color perception is a tricky thing (take home lesson: use color maps to analyze images visually)
* how to override ImageJ1's mouse listeners from a script
* that you can have fun in Fiji

It is also educating to play with the hues that are displayed. The script represents colors in the [[wikipedia:CIELAB|CIELab space]]. The ''L'' axis represents the luminance. The ''a'' and ''b'' axes represent the hue (''a'' is often referred to as the green/red axis and ''b'' as yellow/blue one, but this is not quite an accurate notion).

The four grid lines of the game display evenly spaced color samples along the sides of a quadrilateral in the plane defined by ''L = 72''.

To play with the script, hold down the {{key|Shift}} key and then open the {{bc | Plugins | Examples}} menu and click on ''The Hue Game'' (hold the {{key|Shift}} key pressed down all while doing that). This will open the script in the [[Script Editor]]. Just change the numbers in the second-to-last line of the script (the ''72'' is the luminance, the next parameter is a list of the ''a'' coordinates of the quadrilateral, followed by the ''b'' coordinates). Then call the script with ''Run>Run''.
