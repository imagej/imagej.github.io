This plugin takes a sequence of image slices stored in a folder, and delivers a list of transformed image slices (with enlarged canvas) applying a list of transforms stored as **.XML** files in another folder.

This is a **complementary plugin** of [Register Virtual Stack Slices](Register_Virtual_Stack_Slices "wikilink"). It allows reproducing the results of [Register Virtual Stack Slices](Register_Virtual_Stack_Slices "wikilink") by loading the corresponding transform files (saved by checking the option [ "Save transforms"](Register_Virtual_Stack_Slices#Save_Transforms "wikilink") in the main dialog).

## User Manual

**Premises**:

  - **Source folder**: You have a folder with an ordered list of image files in it that Fiji can open.
  - Each image represents a slice in a sequence.
  - **Output folder**: You have or create a folder to store the resulting virtual stack with the transformed images.
  - **Transform folder**: You have a folder with the transform files (from a [Register Virtual Stack Slices](Register_Virtual_Stack_Slices "wikilink") execution).
  - **Interpolate**: Toggle the interpolation for the result images.

**Step 1**: launch the "Plugins - Transform - Transform Virtual Stack Slices" plugin. 
{% capture title%}
 Transform Virtual Stack main dialog 
{% endcapture %}
{% include thumbnail src='/images/pages/Main-Dialog-Transform Virtual Stack.png' title=title %} **Step 2**: choose the source, output and transform folders:

  - Select a source folder containing the slices, at one slice per image file.
  - Select the target folder where resulting transformed slices will be automatically stored as TIFF files.
  - Select the transform folder, where the .XML files from a [Register Virtual Stack Slices](Register_Virtual_Stack_Slices "wikilink") are stored.

**Results**: on success, a virtual stack will open showing all the transformed images contained in the output folder. The virtual stack can be closed with no ill effect: images are saved in the output folder.
