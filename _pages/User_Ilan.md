## Installation

After installing Fiji, go to "Help" =\> "Update..." =\> "Manage update site" =\> select "PET-CT" =\> apply change.

This will bring up a list of all plugins, not all of which need be installed. For example you may not want Read\_ClearCanvas\_Studies.jar and/or Read\_BI\_Studies.jar. In such cases click on "Status/Action" and choose "Keep as-is"

### The software

  - Pet\_Ct\_Viewer.jar
    This is the basic package needed by all other plugins. [Help](http://sourceforge.net/p/bifijiplugins/wiki/Pet-Ct%20Viewer/)
  - Read\_CD.jar
    This reads from multiple sources and automatically calls Pet Ct Viewer if appropriate. [Help](http://sourceforge.net/p/bifijiplugins/wiki/CD%20Dialog/)
  - Gastric\_Emptying.jar
    This contains multiple Nuclear Medicine and general purpose programs:
      - Gastric Emptying [Help](http://sourceforge.net/p/bifijiplugins/wiki/Gastric%20Emptying/)
      - Renal Clearance [Help](http://sourceforge.net/p/bifijiplugins/wiki/Renal%20Clearance/)
      - Save As Dicom [Help](http://sourceforge.net/p/bifijiplugins/wiki/Save%20as%20myDicom/)
      - Postage Stamps [Help](http://sourceforge.net/p/bifijiplugins/wiki/Postage%20stamps/)
      - Mask [Help](http://sourceforge.net/p/bifijiplugins/wiki/Mask/)
  - Read\_BI\_Studies.jar
    This is for read-write to the Beth Israel miniPacs. [Help](http://sourceforge.net/p/bifijiplugins/wiki/Reading%20studies/) The program to set up the database [createBIdatabase.jar](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bifijiplugins/files/) is not part of Fiji and needs to be downloaded and run separately. [Help](http://sourceforge.net/p/bifijiplugins/wiki/BI%20Database/)
  - Read\_ClearCanvas\_Studies.jar
    This is used for reading Clear Canvas studies. [Help](http://sourceforge.net/p/bifijiplugins/wiki/Clear%20Canvas%20Dialog/)
  - StartupMacros.ijm
    This is the suggested list of programs to automatically start when Fiji is started.
