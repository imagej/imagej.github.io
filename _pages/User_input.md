{% include learn content='scripting' %}Even though one could use any Java library to present a graphical user interface (GUI) for a script or plugin, there are mostly 2 recommended ways to collect input from the user in ImageJ. Both methods can be used with all [available scripting languages](Scripting#Supported_languages ), including the [ImageJ macro language](Macros ).

Script Parameters
-----------------

<img src="/images/pages/Script-parameters.png" title="fig:Script-parameters.png" width="400" alt="Script-parameters.png" /> [Script parameters](Script_parameters ) are a fast, succinct option to make a GUI in ImageJ and beyond. Scripts written using the `#@` parameter syntax can also be consumed by other tools in the [SciJava](SciJava ) ecosystem, including [KNIME](KNIME ), [OMERO](OMERO ) and others. They are independent of user interface, meaning alternative GUIs coded in other frameworks—such as [ImageJFX](ImageJFX ) coded using JavaFX—can also present a GUI for your plugin/script that matches the application.

Each parameter (integer, string input, etc.) corresponds to a user interface element, and is created by using a generic notation in the form `#@ ParameterType variableName` that is put at the top of the script.

There are as many notations/lines as there are items to put in the GUI, and the items are rendered vertically in the resulting interface, in the order of appearance in the code.

See the [script parameters](script_parameters ) page for further details.

GenericDialog
-------------

<img src="/images/pages/Multi-column-dialog.png" title="fig:Multi-column-dialog.png" width="300" alt="Multi-column-dialog.png" /> The [GenericDialog](generic_dialog ) class—part of [ImageJ1](ImageJ1 )—offers more flexibility than the [script parameters](script_parameters ), including custom layout and buttons, but requires more coding—e.g., successive calls to the plugin do not automatically remember previously entered values. Plugins coded using `GenericDialog` are also not automatically usable in other [SciJava](SciJava ) tools such as [KNIME](KNIME ) or [ImageJFX](ImageJFX ).

See the [generic dialog](generic_dialog ) page for further details.
