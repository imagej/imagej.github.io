[AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/) is a tool for [continuous integration](/develop/ci) on [Windows](/platforms/windows) platforms. It is very useful for automating builds, deployment and other tasks.


# Services

Most [SciJava](/libs/scijava)-based project builds use [GitHub Actions](/develop/github-actions). However, some Windows-specific builds use AppVeyor.

See e.g. the [ImageJ Launcher](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/scijava/imagej-launcher) build.
