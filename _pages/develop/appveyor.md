[AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/) is a tool for [continuous integration](/develop/ci) on [Windows](/platforms/windows) platforms. It is very useful for automating builds, deployment and other tasks.

Some [SciJava](/libs/scijava)-based projects used AppVeyor for Windows-specific portions of their builds, particularly in tandem with [Travis CI](/develop/travis) during the 2017-2021 era.
