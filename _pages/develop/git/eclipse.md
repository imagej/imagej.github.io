 This page provides an introduction on how to start using the [EGit](http://www.eclipse.org/egit/) extension in the [Eclipse](/develop/imagej-in-eclipse) IDE for software development.

Installing EGit in Eclipse
--------------------------

In the newer versions of Eclipse, the EGit extension comes already preinstalled. If this should not be so in your case you can install it as follows:

1.  in Eclipse go to {% include bc content='Help |Install New Software...'%}
2.  you can look in the "All Available Sites" drop down panel if EGit is existing there or add update site with the {% include key content='Add..' %} button
3.  enter this URI: http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates
4.  choose the *JGit* and the *Eclipse Team Provider* and {% include key content='Finish' %} the installation

Setting up EGit panels in Eclipse
---------------------------------

To have the EGit panes available you might need to set the following up:

1.  go to {% include bc content='Window |Show View | Others...'%} and select under {% include bc content='|Git'%} at least *Git Repositories* and *Git Staging*
    1.  additionally, it is helpful to add under {% include bc content='|Team'%} *History*

Here you can also find a video tutorial on [integrating github with Eclipse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptK9-CNms98) including already an intro on how to clone a public github repository (see below).

Cloning an existing git repository
----------------------------------

1.  go to github into the repository you wish to clone and copy the URI
2.  switch to the Git repository panel in Eclipse
3.  *Clone a Git Repository* button (in the window which opens up the copied URI should be already specified. If not, change this here)
4.  hit {% include key content='Next &gt;' %} and select the branch(es) you would like to clone (then hit {% include key content='Next &gt;' %})
5.  specify where all your local git repositories sould be stored and press {% include key content='Finish' %}
6.  once the cloned repository is visible in the *Git Repositories* panel, you can right click on it and choose *Import Projects...*
    1.  choose *Import as general project* and press {% include key content='Next &gt;' %}
    2.  specify the projects name and {% include key content='Next &gt;' %}

If the clones repository contains a [Maven](/develop/maven) project, you can then right-click it in Eclipses' package explorer and choose {% include bc content='Configure |Convert to Maven Project'%}

Et voila, ready and all in Eclipse.

Video tutorials on EGit usage
-----------------------------

Furthermore, you will find helpful how-to info for branching, staging, committing, pull- and push actions and merging repos in the following videos:

Surely, command line is for many things more flexible with all the attributes you can use for the commands, but it is easier for the beginning if starting without commandline experience.

Here is a neat (commandline related) interactive page which exlains the different [levels of working with git repositories](http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html)
