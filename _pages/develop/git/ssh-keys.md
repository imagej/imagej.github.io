title: SSH public keys
---

Often, it is inconvenient to input your password all the time when you push/pull via ssh (not using the [contrib user](/develop/git#contrib)).

For such case, you can set up a public/private key pair. Create them with

```shell
ssh-keygen -t dsa
```

Usually, it is a good idea to create a public/private key pair for specific purposes, so that a single compromised key (see [an example](http://www.debian.org/security/2008/dsa-1576) how that can happen even if you did not do anything wrong) does not affect all of your machines. So, change the default name `id_dsa` to something like `id_dsa.fiji` before hitting *Return*.

You can password-protect your private key, in which case you have to use the program {% include wikipedia title='Ssh-agent' text='ssh-agent'%}, but is is usually more convenient to leave the password empty, in which case you are not even asked for it anymore.

Now you should have a file `id_dsa.fiji.pub` (the public key) in addition to `id_dsa.fiji` (the private key).

Add the public key (the single line contained in the file `id_dsa.fiji.pub`) to the file `$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the **remote** computer, i.e. the computer you want to connect to without a password. **Note!** Make sure that the `.ssh/` directory as well as all contained files are owned by the correct user, and that `.ssh/` is accessible to the same user.

For convenience, you should now add a section like this to the file `$HOME/.ssh/config` on the **local** computer, i.e. the computer with the private key:

```
Host fiji.sc  
    User hacker  
    IdentityFile /home/hacker/.ssh/id_dsa.fiji
```

Without this section, you would have to specify both the identity file as well as the user everytime you connect. For even further convenience, you can add a nick name:

```
Host fiji  
    HostName fiji.sc  
    User hacker  
    IdentityFile /home/hacker/.ssh/id_dsa.fiji
```

With this, you can connect to the remote machine with

```shell
ssh fiji
```
