There was an ImageJ community Jenkins server: a continuous integration system which automatically checked the code for build and test errors, but it is now retired.
* From 2017 - 2019, ImageJ-related projects transitioned to [Travis CI](/develop/travis) and [AppVeyor](/develop/appveyor) for CI services.
* As of 2021, ImageJ-related projects are mostly using [GitHub Actions](/develop/github-actions) for CI services.
