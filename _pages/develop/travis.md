[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) is a tool for [continuous integration](/develop/ci). It has excellent integration with [GitHub](/develop/github), and is very useful for automating builds, deployment and other tasks.

SciJava projects used Travis CI for builds, testing, and deployment from 2017 until 2021. The SciJava team no longer provides support for using Travis CI with your project, and recommends using [GitHub Actions](/develop/github-actions) instead.
