ImageJ community members are often available via a couple of different chat services.

{% include notice icon="note" content="**HOWEVER:** It is often better to
use the [Image.sc Forum](https://forum.image.sc/), rather than chat rooms,
because:

1. Conversations in chat will be *less discoverable later* than those on the
   [Image.sc Forum](https://forum.image.sc). The forum is a vital resource for
   the community, providing a searchable history of questions and solutions.
   Have you ever found the answer to a question on forum.image.sc? Now suppose
   that that discussion had happened in chat instead&mdash;would you have found
   that answer?

2. Most of the ImageJ community's image analysis experts monitor the Image.sc
   Forum, not live chat rooms. The contract of the community is:

   > Experts give their time for free&mdash;but in exchange, that help is
   > public, so that others may also benefit long into the future.

Here is a guide for when to use the Image.sc Forum versus chat services:

| Situation                                          | Resource to use                                                                             |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| I want to report a bug in the software.            | See [Reporting Issues](https://imagej.net/discuss/bugs)                                     |
| I need help *analyzing my images*.                 | [Image.sc Forum, Image Analysis category](https://forum.image.sc/c/image-analysis/6)        |
| I need help *managing my image data*.              | [Image.sc Forum, Data Management category](https://forum.image.sc/c/data-management/29)     |
| I need help *using the software tools*.            | [Image.sc Forum, Usage & Issues category](https://forum.image.sc/c/usage-issues/7)          |
| I need help *programming with the software tools*. | [Image.sc Forum, Development category](https://forum.image.sc/c/development/5)              |
| I want to discuss the ImageJ wiki (this website).  | [Image.sc Forum, Websites category](https://forum.image.sc/c/development/5)                 |
| I have an announcement for the community.          | [Image.sc Forum, Announcements category](https://forum.image.sc/c/announcements/10)         |
| I have a job opening to advertise in the field.    | [Image.sc Forum, Job Opportunities category](https://forum.image.sc/c/job-opportunities/11) |
| Posting on the Image.sc Forum is too scary!        | We try our best to be friendly! But if you are allergic to forums, and only chat sustains you, then go ahead and post on Zulip. |
| My topic is something less important to preserve as part of the community knowledge base: e.g. day-to-day project logistics, or time-sensitive discussion that will become less relevant after the fact. | [Image.sc Zulip instance](https://imagesc.zulipchat.com/) |

## Zulip

{% include wikipedia title='Zulip' text='Zulip' %} is an open-source alternative to Slack and similar tools. It is a nice way to discuss things with the ImageJ community in real time.

Several ImageJ-related projects have channels on the [Image.sc Zulip instance](https://imagesc.zulipchat.com/):

| Logo                                       | Project                                      | Channel       |

| ![](/media/icons/fiji.png){:width="48"}    | [Fiji](/software/fiji)                       | `#Fiji`       |
| ![](/media/icons/imglib2.png){:width="48"} | [ImgLib2](/libs/imglib2)                     | `#ImgLib2`    |

## Gitter

The {% include wikipedia title='Gitter' text='Gitter' %} chat service is how developers of [SciJava](/libs/scijava)-based software have been discussing day-to-day issues for the past several years. You can participate, too: all you need is either a [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) account. Advantages of Gitter (compared to IRC) include a nice "21st century" web interface, email notification when participants miss messages, and a full searchable history. But it seems the community is trending more toward Zulip (see above), so it is not clear for how much longer the Gitter rooms will stay active.

## IRC

Long ago, some community members frequented {% include wikipedia title='Internet Relay Chat' text='IRC' %} on [irc.freenode.net](http://freenode.net/), in the following chat rooms:

| Channel       | Description                                                         |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `#imagejdev`  | Core ImageJ development discussion.                                 |
| `#fiji-devel` | [Fiji](/software/fiji) user and developer discussion and questions. |

Advantages of IRC include anonymity, and maximum compatibility with a huge variety of existing chat clients.

But active core developers of ImageJ-related projects have not monitored these rooms for many years, and since the [Freenode "hostile takeover" of 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenode), the rooms might not even exist anymore.

Chat logs from these channels can be downloaded from [here](https://code.imagej.net/irc-logs/).
