ImageJ User and Developer Conferences
-------------------------------------

![](/media/Imagej-conference-logo.png "Imagej-conference-logo.png")

Approximately every two years from 2006 through 2015, there was a conference focused on [ImageJ](/about)-based software, including both the core program itself, as well as applications and [plugins](/fiji/plugins) thereof.

As the community has grown, the ecosystem of imaging software tools has grown increasingly powerful and diverse, and therefore, the scope of the conferences has grown as well. In 2018, the conference name was changed to communicate this evolution of scope.

### Future conferences

#### I2K 2020

“From Images to Knowledge with ImageJ & Friends (I2K)” was originally scheduled for September 17-18, 2020 in Madison, WI. Due to travel restrictions during this continued health crisis, this in-person meeting in Madison, WI has been postponed (see details below). However, we are pleased to announce an online I2K meeting at HHMI Janelia this **Nov 30-Dec 2, 2020**. For more information, follow [this link](https://www.janelia.org/you-janelia/conferences/from-images-to-knowledge-with-imagej-friends-virtual).

This online version, similar to the past in-person meetings, is open to all and will cover the vast ecosystem of open-source imaging software tools. We are excited by the online format of I2K 2020 and anticipate it will help shape the format of I2K 2021 as well.

#### I2K 2021

The [Center for Open Bioimage Analysis (COBA)](/orgs/coba) at Broad Institute and UW-Madison, as well as the [Fiji](/fiji) development team at Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden, is pleased to formally announce the 2021 "From Images to Knowledge with ImageJ & Friends (I2K)" Symposium.

-   Date: September 23-24, 2021
-   Location: University of Wisconsin, Madison
-   Registration: TBD

If you have any questions or if you are interested in hosting a future conference focused on scientific imaging software, please start a thread on the [Image.sc Forum](https://forum.image.sc/).
