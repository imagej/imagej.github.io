The first DAIS Learnathon took place from June 18 until June 24 2017.

Schedule
--------

See [this page](https://indico.mpi-cbg.de/event/50/other-view?view=standard)!

Setting up your system
----------------------

Check if you have this set up:

-   Jupyter + the SciJava kernel (https://github.com/scijava/scijava-jupyter-kernel)
    -   Install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) if you do not have installed it or Anaconda already. (We need the version for Python 3!)
    -   Your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` will need a line like this: `export PATH="/Users/someforders/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"`
    -   Make a new conda environment and install `jupyter` and `scijava-jupiter-kernel`:
                      conda create --name scijava python=3
                      source activate scijava
                      conda install jupyter
                      conda config --add channels conda-forge
                      conda install scijava-jupyter-kernel

    -   Now (and in the future) you will have to activate the environment we just created: `source activate scijava`.
    -   Deactivation would work like this: `source deactivate`
    -   Get some notebook to try it out:
                      git clone git@github.com:scijava/scijava-jupyter-kernel
                      cd scijava-jupyter-kernel
                      jupyter notebook

    -   Execute cells by hitting <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd>â€”enjoy!
-   Eclipse (Neon)
-   bash / zsh
-   GIT
-   Maven
-   Gitter

This can happen later:

-   imglyb (forget that for now)

Monday
------

Git repos to clone:

-   [`https://github.com/imagej/tutorials`](https://github.com/imagej/tutorials)
-   [`https://github.com/imagej/imagej`](https://github.com/imagej/imagej)
-   [`https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common`](https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common) (optional)

Slides online:

### Ops practical

Write your first `Command` plugin!

-   Try to do it completely on your own, using Internet resources.
-   If you get stuck, click on hint links.
-   If still stuck, ***grab a teacher***!

Details of your assignment:

-   Create a [Git](Git) repository.
-   Create a [Maven](/develop/maven) project. (hints: [1](https://github.com/imagej/example-imagej-command), [2](/develop/building-a-pom))
-   Implement a `Command` plugin in your [IDE](/develop/ides), which calculates the *mean* across an image. (hints: [1](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/imagej/tutorials/blob/master/notebooks/1_-_Using_ImageJ/2_-_Introduction_to_ImageJ_Ops.ipynb), [2](https://github.com/imagej/tutorials/tree/master/maven-projects/simple-commands/src/main/java))
-   Push to [GitHub](/develop/github) (hints: [1](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/), [2](https://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net/)).

If you get that far, YOU WIN. {% include person content='Jug' %} has a reward for you.

Extra credit:

-   Grab fun snippets from the "Introduction to Ops" Jupyter notebook.
-   Integrate them into your command, to make it do fancier things.

### How to create a new git repository

This is, from my (Hanslovsky) point of view, the best way to create a new git repository. All commands should run on Linux, OSX, and the git bash shell on Windows.

-   Create a new repository on github.com (choose not to add a README.md or .gitignore), e.g. with name 'awesome-learnathon'
-   On your local machine create a directory where you would like to have the repository and cd into it: `mkdir 'awesome-learnathon' && cd 'awesome-learnathon'`
-   Initalize local git repository: `git init`
-   Add remote repository as origin: `git remote add -f origin git@github.com:user/awesome-learnathon` or `git remote add -f origin `[`https://github.com/user/awesome-learnathon`](https://github.com/user/awesome-learnathon) if you did not set up git through ssh. The `-f` parameter fetches from the remote repository
-   Create a first file, e.g. `pom.xml`, and stage it for a commit: `git add pom.xml`
-   Commit the stage files with commit message: `git commit -m 'Add pom.xml'`
-   Push your commit: `git push --set-upstream origin master` (you can ommit `--set-upstream origin master` in future commits)
