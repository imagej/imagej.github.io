Thanks to ImageJ's [extensibility](/Architecture#Extensibility) via [plugins](/fiji/plugins), it supports a lot of image formats!

Life sciences
-------------

The [OME Bio-Formats](/formats/bio-formats) plugins provide support for over 130 file formats in microscopy, medical imaging, and related life science formats. Bio-Formats is included with the [Fiji](/fiji) distribution of ImageJ. See also the Bio-Formats [list of supported formats](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/bio-formats/supported-formats.html).

DICOM
-----

ImageJ has some built-in support for the DICOM format, and there are also plugins for working with DICOM files. See the [DICOM](/formats/dicom) page for full details.

HDF
---

The HDF5 [update site](Update_site) enables support for reading and writing [HDF5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format "wikilink") image data. Note that HDF5 is a very broad specification; the HDF5 plugin will not support all manner of HDF files, but only those written according to its constraints.

Video
-----

Out of the box, ImageJ has limited support for some video formats such as AVI and [QuickTime](/formats/quicktime), and there are also plugins which extend ImageJ's support for videos. See the [Video](/formats/video) page for details.
