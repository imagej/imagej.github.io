If you have Flex files from an older Opera system, you may receive a message from [Bio-Formats](/formats/bio-formats) stating that you need a LuraWave LWF license code to decode these files.

Decoding Flex files using the MBF distribution
----------------------------------------------

The [MBF Plugin Collection](/software/mbf-imagej) legally bundles the LuraWave LWF decoder module: [McMaster University](http://www.mcmaster.ca/) purchased a redistributable license from LuraTech (see below).

Steps to use:

1.  [Download ImageJ 1.x](https://imagej.net/download.html) and unpack it
2.  [Download the MBF Plugins Collection](https://imagej.net/plugins/mbf/)
3.  Merge the MBF plugins into your ImageJ 1.x folder
4.  Use {% include bc content='File | Open...'%} to convert your .flex files to OME-TIFF using [Bio-Formats](/formats/bio-formats)

Unfortunately, for legal reasons, we cannot elaborate on the technical details of how the MBF collection provides this functionality, nor can we legally make this feature available within [ImageJ2](/software/imagej2) or [Fiji](/fiji).

Purchasing your own license
---------------------------

Alternately, the LuraWave decoder is proprietary software which you can (theoretically) purchase from [LuraTech](https://www.luratech.com/en/). However, we do not know the details of who to contact, nor how much it costs to do so.
