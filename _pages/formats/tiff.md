The {% include wikipedia title='TIFF' text='TIFF file format'%} is one of the most widely used formats in biosciences. Many commercial instruments write images using some flavor of TIFF. It is used in [open source](Open_source) efforts as well; for example, the [Open Microscopy Environment](/software/omero) developed the [OME-TIFF format](http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/ome-model/ome-tiff/) as an open exchange standard for microscopy data.

## ImageJ 1.x support

[ImageJ 1.x](/software/imagej1) (and therefore [ImageJ2](/software/imagej2) in its default legacy mode) has built-in support for TIFF files via the {% include bc path='File | Open...'%} command.

You can also import TIFFs as [virtual stacks](/ij/docs/guide/146-8.html#sub:Virtual-Stacks) via the {% include bc path='File | Import | TIFF Virtual Stack...'%} command.

-   **Pro:** The ImageJ 1.x TIFF reader is very fast.
-   **Con:** The ImageJ 1.x TIFF support is incomplete. Some valid baseline TIFF files will not open properly. In particular, TIFF files with out-of-order planes cannot be opened.

## Bio-Formats

The [Bio-Formats](/formats/bio-formats) plugins offer a more complete TIFF importer, accessible via the {% include bc path='File | Import | Bio-Formats'%} command.

-   **Pro:** The Bio-Formats TIFF reader can handle many more varieties of TIFF.
-   **Con:** The Bio-Formats TIFF support is not as speedy as ImageJ1's TIFF reader.

## SCIFIO

The [SCIFIO](/software/scifio) library, the I/O library of [ImageJ2](/software/imagej2), imports TIFF files using code adapted from the [Bio-Formats](/formats/bio-formats) project. As such, it is similar to Bio-Formats in that it supports a wider variety of TIFFs, but is less performant than the ImageJ 1.x reader. SCIFIO is accessible via the {% include bc path='File | Import | Image...'%} command.

You can tell ImageJ2 to use SCIFIO by default via the {% include bc path='Edit | Options | ImageJ2...'%} menu's "Use SCIFIO when opening files (BETA!)" checkbox.
