title: Editing the Wiki - Headers

This page showcases the look of different header levels.

In Markdown, you make a header by prefacing the section title with
a number of `#` symbols, up to a maximum of six (for `<h6>`).

Using headers to delineate content sections has some advantages:

* Headers will automatically have a slugified `id` added,
  to facilitate linking to particular sections using anchors.
* A table of contents (in the right sidebar by default) will be automatically
  generated according to the declared headers&mdash;as long as there are at
  least three of them.

# Closing remarks

This section here at the bottom exists merely to trigger the table of contents
to generate on this page, so that you can see how it looks. Cheers!
