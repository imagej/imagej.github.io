This page documents includes for symbols commonly used on the site.

There are includes for a predetermined list of frequently used symbols. If you
would like to use a symbol not on the list, you can add it as an
image file with the [img include](/help/editing/images) feature,
or encode it directly with HTML using Unicode.

The site currently supports the following symbols as includes:

<table style="border: 1px solid gray">
<tr><th>Code</th><th>Symbol</th></tr>
<tr><td markdown=1>
{% raw %}`{% include yes %}`{% endraw %}
</td><td>{% include yes %}</td></tr>
<tr><td markdown=1>
{% raw %}`{% include no %}`{% endraw %}
</td><td>{% include no %}</td></tr>
</table>
