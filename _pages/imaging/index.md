This section is an introduction to scientific imaging, including both
image acquisition and image analysis, with a focus on ImageJ.

Cooks call them *recipes*, biologists *protocols*, and programmers call them
*HOWTOs*. No matter how you refer to them, you'll find all the topics in the
nav-bar at the top of the page!

Like the rest of this wiki, this guide is a community project.
Please feel welcome to edit and expand the material here!

  *please peruse the [Principles](/imaging/principles)* for a primer!" %}
