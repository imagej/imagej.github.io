There are a many different derivatives of ImageJ with very similar names, and some confusion is inevitable. Below is a table which should help to clarify the purpose of each. For the historical context of these projects, see [History](#history) below.

## History

The first imaging program that {% include person id='rasband' %} developed, starting in the late 70s, was called simply "Image". It was written in Pascal, ran on PDP-11 minicomputers and ran in only 64KB of memory! Rasband started work on the second, [NIH Image](/software/nih-image), in 1987 when the Mac II became available. Rasband was a Mac enthusiast, and the Mac II had card slots just like the PDP-11. Rasband started work on ImageJ in 1997, when Java was becoming popular. Rasband was intrigued by the idea of creating a version of NIH Image that would "run anywhere", including as an applet in Web browsers.
