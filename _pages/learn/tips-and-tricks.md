ImageJ is easy to use, but sometimes you wish for some function that is actually implemented, yet you do not know how to trigger. This page lists a few of those tricks.

Show the memory consumption
---------------------------

Just click on the status bar, and you will see how much memory is used, and how much memory is available.

Execute external programs
-------------------------

The macro language allows executing programs, and capturing their output:

`output = exec("dir /w");`

Quickly see return values
-------------------------

You do not need to wrap macro calls into write() calls: if you just write something like

`getDirectory("plugins");`

the return value will appear in your Log window when called.

Find out in which menu (or .jar file) a certain command is
----------------------------------------------------------

Hit {% include key content='Ctrl\|L' %} to start the [Command Finder](/Using_the_Command_Launcher). Type (part of) the name of the entry, then click on *Show full information*.

If *{% include bc content='Edit | Options | Misc...'%}&gt;Require command key for shortcuts* is *un*checked, typing {% include key content='L' %} is sufficient.

Put the main window to the foreground
-------------------------------------

Pressing the {% include key content='Return' %} key on any image will bring the main window to the foreground.

Close all images (without being asked whether to save them)
-----------------------------------------------------------

{% include bc content='Plugins | Utilities | Close All Without Saving'%}

Set the foreground color
------------------------

Double-click on the pipette, or hit {% include key content='Ctrl\|Shift\|K' %} (on Macs, it is {% include key content='Cmd\|Shift\|K' %}), or select the menu item ''{% include bc content='Image | Color | Color Picker...'%}

Set the line width
------------------

Line selections can have a width larger than one, which also has an effect on line profiles. You can set it by double clicking on the line selection tool, or by calling {% include bc content='Edit | Options | Line Width...'%}

Quickly copy a ROI from one image to another
--------------------------------------------

Simply activate the image with the desired ROI, then the image you want to put that ROI into, and hit {% include key content='Ctrl\|Shift\|E' %}. This triggers the {% include bc content='Edit | Selection | Restore Selection'%} which "restores" the selection.
