IJ-OpenCV is a Java library allowing the conversion between [ImageJ 1.x](/software/imagej) and [OpenCV](/software/opencv) objects (images, rois...).  The [github page of IJ-OpenCV](https://github.com/joheras/IJ-OpenCV) contains all the information to download and install this library. The [wiki section](https://github.com/joheras/IJ-OpenCV/wiki) of the repository will help you to get started, and a set of examples are also provided.

There are several benefits provided by the communication of ImageJ and OpenCV obtained thanks to the IJ-OpenCV library. From the ImageJ perspective, this tool is enhanced with several computer vision and machine learning algorithms, avoiding the re-implementation of methods and the connection with several external libraries. From the OpenCV point of view, this library is improved with a simple-to-use GUI and with the functionality to manage regions of interest.

IJ-OpenCV has been built on top of [SciJava Common](/libs/scijava#scijava-common) using SciJava converters.

Several ImageJ plugins have been developed using this library and can be easily downloaded and installed using the [ImageJ Update site](http://sites.imagej.net/IJ-OpenCV/).
