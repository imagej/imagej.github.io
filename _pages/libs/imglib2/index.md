project-blurb: the ImgLib2 multidimensional image processing library
---

ImgLib2 is a general-purpose, multidimensional image processing library.

It provides an interface-driven design that supports numeric and non-numeric data types (8-bit unsigned integer, 32-bit floating point, etc.) in an extensible way. It implements several data sources and sample organizations, including one single primitive array, one array per plane, N-dimensional array "cells" cached to and from disk on demand, and planes read on demand from disk.

## Source code

You can find the source {% include github org='imglib' repo='imglib2' %}.

There is also a continuous integration system that builds ImgLib2 [every time the code changes](https://travis-ci.org/imglib/imglib2).

## ImgLib2 vs. ImgLib1

[ImgLib1](/libs/imglib1) is the previous incarnation of the library. We encourage developers to use ImgLib2 instead, and [migrate existing ImgLib1 programs to ImgLib2](/libs/imglib2/migrate-from-imglib1) whenever possible.

For an explanation of how ImgLib2 has changed from ImgLib1, see the [Changes from ImgLib1 to ImgLib2](/libs/imglib2/changes-from-imglib1) page.

See the [How To Migrate Code From ImgLib To ImgLib2](/libs/imglib2/migrate-from-imglib1) page for details on how to update your ImgLib1-based code to use ImgLib2.
