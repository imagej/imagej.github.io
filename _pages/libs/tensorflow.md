[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an [open-source](/licensing/open-source) software library for {% include wikipedia title='Artificial intelligence' text='machine intelligence' %}.

The [ImageJ-TensorFlow](https://github.com/imagej/imagej-tensorflow) project enables TensorFlow to be used from ImageJ commands and scripts. Some ImageJ plugins currently use TensorFlow to classify images according to pre-trained models. Future plugins are planned which will support refining models based on additional training images from ImageJ.
