## Apache License 2.0

The **Apache 2** license is a permissive license, similar to the [MIT](/licensing/mit) and
[BSD](/licensing/bsd) licenses, but with additional protection against patent-related
lawsuits. A licensee of Apache-2-licensed software can:

- Use, copy and distribute the unmodified source or binary forms of the
  licensed program
- Use, copy and distribute modified source or binary forms of the licensed
  program, provided that all distributed copies are accompanied by the license
