**BSD licenses** are a family of **permissive**
[free software](/licensing/open-source) licenses, imposing minimal
restrictions on the redistribution of covered software. This is in contrast to
{% include wikipedia title='Copyleft' text='copyleft'%}
licenses like the [GPL](/licensing/gpl), which have reciprocity share-alike requirements.
The original BSD license was used for its namesake, the Berkeley Software
Distribution (BSD), a Unix-like operating system. The original version has
since been revised and its descendants are more properly termed modified BSD
licenses.

See the
{% include wikipedia title='BSD licenses' text='Wikipedia article on BSD licenses' %}
for more information.

## Simplified BSD License

The **Simplified BSD** (or **BSD 2-clause**) license is the simplest BSD
license. A licensee of BSD-licensed software can:

- Use, copy and distribute the unmodified source or binary forms of the
  licensed program
- Use, copy and distribute modified source or binary forms of the licensed
  program, provided that all distributed copies are accompanied by the license

## Modified BSD License

The **Modified** or **New BSD** (or **BSD 3-clause**) license is the same as
BSD-2, but with an additional clause prohibiting the names of the authors from
being used to endorse or promote products relating to the software.
