The **GNU General Public License** is a free,
**{% include wikipedia title='Copyleft' text='copyleft' %}**
[open source](Open_source) license for software and other kinds of works. This
is in contrast to **permissive** licenses like [BSD](/licensing/bsd), which impose minimal
restrictions on the redistribution of covered software. The GPL ensures that
granted freedoms are preserved whenever the work is distributed, even when the
work is changed or added to.
