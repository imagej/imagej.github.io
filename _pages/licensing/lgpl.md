The **GNU Lesser General Public License** is a free, [open source](Open_source)
license for software and other kinds of works. It is a middle ground between
**{% include wikipedia title='Copyleft' text='copyleft'%}** licenses such as
the [GPL](/licensing/gpl) and **permissive** licenses like [BSD](/licensing/bsd) and [MIT](/licensing/mit).
The LGPL requires modifications to the work to also be distributed under OSS
terms, but allows the work to be included (unmodified) in non-OSS combined
works without propagating its terms onto the combined work itself.

As such, the LGPL is considered a more "commercial friendly" license than the
GPL, since LGPL libraries can be freely utilized by commercial software.

See the
{% include wikipedia title='GNU Lesser General Public License' text='Wikipedia article on the LGPL'%}
for more information.
