The **MIT License** is a **permissive**
[free software](/licensing/open-source) license, imposing minimal
restrictions on the redistribution of covered software. This is in contrast to
{% include wikipedia title='Copyleft' text='copyleft'%} licenses like the
[GPL](/licensing/gpl), which have reciprocity share-alike requirements. The MIT license is
named for the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://mit.edu/), where
it originated.

See the

for more information.

## MIT License

The **MIT** license is a simple permissive license, functionally equivalent to
the [Simplified BSD License](/licensing/bsd). A licensee of MIT-licensed software can:

- Use, copy and distribute the unmodified source or binary forms of the
  licensed program
- Use, copy and distribute modified source or binary forms of the licensed
  program, provided that all distributed copies are accompanied by the license
