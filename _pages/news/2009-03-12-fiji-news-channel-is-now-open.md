Fiji now has its own news channel. We will use this feed to post news related to Fiji development and relevant events. Stay tuned!

If you need to post a news event, simly use the Fiji wiki to do so:

-   Create an article in the wiki
-   For archiving reason, please name it as
        `yyyy-mm-dd - news title`
    so that items are sorted chronologically in the category.
-   Add the category tag:
        `[[Category:News]]`
    at the end of the page

That's all! Enjoy!
