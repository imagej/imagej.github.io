Fiji now includes the [Auto Threshold](/plugins/auto-threshold) from Gabriel Landini, that can binarise 8-bit images using various global (histogram-derived) thresholding methods. As a consequence, the [MultiThresholder](/plugins/multithresholder) plugin will soon be marked as deprecated and removed from distribution.
