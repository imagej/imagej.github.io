title: "2009-04-20 - Summer of Code: We got us three students"
---

Even if we did not get the number of slots we wished for -- by far -- the summer of code is *on*!

These are the three projects:

-   Yap Chin Kiet will improve the Fiji Plugin Manager, mentored by Mark Longair,
-   Sumit Dubey will implement a Scripting Editor, mentored by Albert Cardona, and
-   Chandan Kumar will integrate JMathLib ([MATLAB](/scripting/matlab) clone in java) into Fiji as a new scripting language, mentored by Johannes Schindelin.

Let the party begin!
