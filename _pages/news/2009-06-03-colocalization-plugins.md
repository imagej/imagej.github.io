By request of Daniel James White, we now have Colocalization plugins in [Fiji](/fiji). We took two plugins from the [MBF Plugin Collection](/software/mbf-imagej), fixed them to work with newer [ImageJ](/about) versions, and put them into the Fiji [Updater](/plugins/updater). Oh, and of course, they are {% include github org='fiji' repo='Colocalisation\_Analysis' %}, too.
