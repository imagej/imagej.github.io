title: 2009-06-16 - ImageJA enhancements
---

In Fiji, we do not use ImageJ directly, as we need some special enhancements, or we have some features early that then trickle into ImageJ. And so we got a number of enhancements in our current version of ImageJA in addition to synchronizing with the ImageJ version 1.42q:

-   When a duplicate menu entry was found, the message is more helpful now: it says which *.jar* file the conflict stems from.
-   {% include bc path='Help | Update ImageJ...'%} was reenabled, fixing a bug on MacOSX.
-   {% include bc path='Plugins | Utilities | Find Commands...'%} now shows the .jar file too when full info is displayed.

The update is available via {% include bc path='Help | Update Fiji'%} (as *ij.jar*).
