There was an obscure bug in the early 1.43 versions that was triggered by loading .lif files with Bio-Formats on Windows, and resulted in a crash of the Java Virtual Machine. This is fixed by 1.43c.

For good measure, 1.43d was merged, which has many cool features, for example you can drag images from a page in your web browser directly onto the main Fiji window, and it will be opened in Fiji!
