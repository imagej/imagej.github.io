title: 2009-10-12 - Fiji got a YouTube channel!
---

Thanks to the effort of {% include person id='iarganda' %}, we have a [channel on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/fijichannel)!

This channel has a few tutorials and a fun view of the Fiji development already, and we will add other movies as we make them.
