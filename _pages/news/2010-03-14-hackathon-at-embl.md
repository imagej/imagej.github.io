Between March 15th and March 26th we will be holding a hackathon at [EMBL](http://embl.de), one of the premium bioscience centers in Europe. The so called <i>get-together@EMBL</i> is [generously hosted](https://wiki.cmci.info/meeting/fiji2010) by Francesca Peri (group leader at EMBL Developmental Biology Programme) and Kota Miura (EMBL Centre for Molecular and Cellular Imaging).
