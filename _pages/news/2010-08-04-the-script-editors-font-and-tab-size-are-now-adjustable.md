title: 2010-08-04 - The Script Editor's font and tab size are now adjustable
---

Thanks to Yili Zhao, the [Script Editor](/scripting/script-editor) got menu entries in the *Edit* menu to adjust the font size and the tab width. The font size can be adjusted using the {% include key keys='Ctrl|-' %} and {% include key keys='Ctrl|+' %} keyboard shortcuts, too. As a goodie, the tab width is automatically adjusted to 4 spaces for Python scripts, for everything else it still defaults to 8 spaces.
