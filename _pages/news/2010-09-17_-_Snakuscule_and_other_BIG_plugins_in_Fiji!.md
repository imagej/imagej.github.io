A little [Snakuscule](/plugins/snakuscule) snake snaked its way into Fiji! [Amongst other plugins](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/algorithms.html), the good people from the [Biomedical Imaging Group](http://bigwww.epfl.ch) of the EPFL in Switzerland kindly permitted us to redistribute the Snakuscule plugin!

After updating Fiji, you will find the menu item {% include bc content='Plugins | Segmentation | Snakuscule'%}. After clicking on it, you will see two concentric circles on your image -- the Snakuscule. After putting it roughly into a place of a blob-like structure in your image, clicking on the optimization button in the toolbar will fit the Snakuscule to the structure in the image as well as possible.
