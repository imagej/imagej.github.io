title: 2010-09-21 - Fiji comes with complete source code now -- thanks to TransformJ!
---

This is a great day for Fiji. Thanks to Erik Meijering, we are permitted to ship [TransformJ](/plugins/transformj) and its source within Fiji! While at it, Erik also extended the permission to the [RandomJ](/plugins/randomj) and [FeatureJ](/plugins/featurej) plugins.

Thank you, Erik!
