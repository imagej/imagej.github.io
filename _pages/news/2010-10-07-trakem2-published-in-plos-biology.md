Big day for Fiji. [TrakEM2](/plugins/trakem2) which is a BIG part of Fiji played a central role in the paper published this week in [PLoS Biology](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000502) titled

"An Integrated Micro- and Macroarchitectural Analysis of the Drosophila Brain by Computer-Assisted Serial Section Electron Microscopy."

It is a culmination of a long-term collaboration between researchers from the Institute of Neuroinformatics ETH Zurich ({% include person id='acardona' %}), the Department of Molecular Cell and Developmental Biology UCLA ([Volker Hartenstein](http://www.mcdb.ucla.edu/Research/Hartenstein)) and the MPI-CBG (particularly [Stephan Saalfeld](http://fly.mpi-cbg.de/~saalfeld/) who wrote the algorithms behind TrakEM2 registration published separately in [Bioinformatics](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/12/i57.full?sid=8ff2b8c5-158d-461e-ab2e-b2fc5bdca5df)).

All papers, software and data are Open Access showing the way of how science should be done in the 21st century.

Congratulations to Albert Cardona, also known as the "Father of Fiji", for this _tour de force_ effort!
