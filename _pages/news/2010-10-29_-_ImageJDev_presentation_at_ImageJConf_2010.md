We attended the [ImageJ User & Developer Conference 2010](/events/Conference_2010), which was really fun and informative. We gave a talk on ImageJDev describing our vision, aims, proposed design for ImageJ 2.0, current progress and future directions, which you can access below, including speaker notes:
