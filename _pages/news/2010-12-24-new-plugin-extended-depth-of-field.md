title: "2010-12-24 - New plugin: Extended Depth of Field"
---

Thanks to the generous people at the [Biomedical Imaging Group of the EPFL](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/), we are now allowed to ship the [Extended Depth of Field](/plugins/extended-depth-of-field) plugin with sources!

The plugin is useful if you recorded a sample at different focal depths and you want to have a single two-dimensional image showing as much in-focus information as possible.

Merry Christmas!
