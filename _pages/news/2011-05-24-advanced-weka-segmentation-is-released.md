title: 2011-05-24 - Advanced Weka Segmentation is released
---

We have implemented and released a new and advanced machine-learning-based segmentation plugin: [Advanced Weka Segmentation](/plugins/tws). The core of the plugin is the [Trainable Segmentation](/plugins/tws) plugin but it includes now many more capabilities and features. The user can choose between any classifier available in the latest version of [Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/), load/save all data and classifiers, select and tune many more features, get a probability map rather than a binary image, interact directly with the [Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) GUI, record the plugin actions in the macro recorder, call the plugin methods from another plugin or script...

The plugin is still experimental, but please, go ahead and use it. Any feedback is welcome!
