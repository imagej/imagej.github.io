title: 2011-12-16 - Domain name updates
---

As [mentioned on the mailing list](/pipermail/imagej-devel/2011-November/000544.html), we have updated our web resources to be more unified under the **imagej.net** domain name:

-   **imagejdev.org** is now **developer.imagej.net**
-   **dev.imagejdev.org** is now **code.imagej.net**
-   The toplevel **imagej.net** currently redirects to **imagej.nih.gov/ij** but will become the main portal into ImageJ topics later in 2012.

Most of the links on the site have been updated accordingly, but any old links should also redirect properly.

Those who have the code checked out from Subversion will need to run:

```shell
svn switch --relocate http://dev.imagejdev.org/svn/imagej http://code.imagej.net/svn/imagej
```
Or if you have cloned the Git mirror:

```shell
git remote set-url origin git://code.imagej.net/imagej.git
```
We hope the new domain is less confusing and easier to remember!
