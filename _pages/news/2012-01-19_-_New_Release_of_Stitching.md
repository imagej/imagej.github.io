You can now reconstruct arbitrarily sized, tiled acquisitions (which can be multi-channel, time-lapse stacks) with just very little RAM (even &lt;1GB) if you activate the options to write the result directly to disk and/or open the input stacks only virtually!!

Here is a list of all new highlights:

-   supports composite images and hyperstacks now (arbitrary amount of channels and time-points)
-   can optionally write the stitched image slice-by-slice directly to disk (significantly reduces the RAM requirements)
-   can optionally open the input images as Virtual Stacks (significantly reduces the RAM requirements)
-   supports timelapse alignment with different stitching options
-   subpixel-resolution
-   supports many different types of grids (row-by-row, column-by-column, snake, ...)
-   can read the approximate tile positions from the image metadata
-   finally based on ImgLib

There are only two plugins left, they replace the Stitching2D/3D and the Stitch Grid, ... Sequence, ... Collection and so on. They are called:

-   **Stitching -&gt; Pairwise Stitching**
-   **Stitching -&gt; Grid/Collection Stitching**

You will find a complete documentation on the Fiji wiki: [Image\_Stitching](/plugins/image-stitching)

The Stitching is deployed as a component of Fiji (simply update Fiji) or you can download it for ImageJ as a stand-alone package which includes all necessary libraries (11MB): [Download...](http://fly.mpi-cbg.de/~preibisch/software.html#Stitching)

I thank all the authors of the libraries and other people who helped me with the Stitching: [ Acknowledgements](Image_Stitching#Download_for_ImageJ_.26_Acknowledgements)

Last but not least, it would be really nice if you could cite the publication that is associated with the plugin:
