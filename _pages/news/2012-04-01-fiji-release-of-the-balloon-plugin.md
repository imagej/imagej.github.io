Lionel Dupuy, the author of the [Balloon](/plugins/balloon) plugin, donated the source code to Fiji. It is a plugin that helps segmenting cells and cell boundaries.

We timed the publication of the source code and the compiled plugin to coincide with the availability of the corresponding [Nature Methods paper](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nmeth.1940.html).

Thanks Lionel!
