On April 30 through May 1 we attended a Bioimage Analysis Workshop in Barcelona entitled "[Bioimage analysis software: is there a future beyond ImageJ?](ISBI_2012)" We presented the current status and future directions of [ImageJ2](/software/imagej2).

It was great meeting with developers of related projects, including [OME](/software/omero), [KNIME Image Processing](/software/knime), [Icy](/software/icy) and [BioImageXD](/software/bioimagexd)! The big takeaway message of the workshop was interoperability: we are all striving to make our software work together well, so that users can combine them and benefit from all our efforts.
