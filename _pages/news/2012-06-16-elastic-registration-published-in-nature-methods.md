Stephan Saalfeld's elastic registration algorithm for serial section microscopy was published in [Nature Methods](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nmeth.2072.html) [^1]. The programs implementing the approach have been already available for some months in Fiji both as a standalone [plugin](/plugins/elastic-alignment-and-montage) and as part of Albert Cardona's [TrakEM2](/plugins/trakem2) suite.

The paper is accompanied by a number of spectacular videos visualizing the method, the evaluation and the results for electron microscopy and array tomography section series. Check out the movies [here](http://fly.mpi-cbg.de/elastic). Additionally, you can browse through the reconstructed C. elegans dataset (courtesy of Rick Fetter from the Janelia Farm) with [CATMAID](http://fly.mpi-cbg.de/c-elegans).

Congratulations to everyone involved, particularly Stephan!
