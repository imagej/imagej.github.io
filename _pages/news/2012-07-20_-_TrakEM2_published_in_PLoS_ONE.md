The [TrakEM2](/plugins/trakem2) software has been published in [PLoS ONE](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0038011) [1], establishing a primary reference for this program. [TrakEM2](/plugins/trakem2) started in 2005 when {% include person content='Albertcardona' %} worked for the whole Summer with [Rodney J. Douglas](http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~rjd/) at the Institute of Neuroinformatics in Zurich, Switzerland, to establish an ImageJ-based program to aid in the reconstruction of neural circuits from large image volumes.

In its path, TrakEM2 fostered the development of software libraries for image registration, leading to the extraordinary work of [Stephan Saalfeld](http://fly.mpi-cbg.de/saalfeld) and [Stephan Preibisch](http://fly.mpi-cbg.de/preibisch) at the lab of [Pavel Tomancak](http://www.mpi-cbg.de/research/research-groups/pavel-tomancak.html) at MPI-CBG, Dresden. Albert Cardona's work on TraKEM2 contributed to the VIB libraries by Johannes Schindelin, Bene Schmid and Mark Longair, and in particular to the development of the [3D Viewer](/plugins/3d-viewer)[2] for the rendering of meshes and skeletons in 3D. The [scripting](Category_Scripting) utilities now present in Fiji, and Fiji itself, spinned off from work in or related to TrakEM2.

[TrakEM2](/plugins/trakem2) has now reached [version 1.0](http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~acardona/trakem2.html) and is feature complete.
