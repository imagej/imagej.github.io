On October 24 - 26 we attended the [ImageJ User & Developer Conference 2012](/events/Conference_2012) in Luxembourg. We presented the current status and future directions of [ImageJ2](/software/imagej2), [ImgLib2](/imglib2) and [Fiji](/fiji). The [ImageJ2 presentation](http://conference.imagej.net/2012/curtis-rueden/2012-10-24-imagej-conference.odp) included a discussion of vision and what we believe makes a truly open project which best benefits the scientific community. We also ran workshops on ImageJ2 and ImgLib2 software development.

Once again it was great meeting with users, as well as developers of related projects such as [KNIME Image Processing](http://tech.knime.org/community/image-processing) and [Bio7](http://bio7.org/)!
