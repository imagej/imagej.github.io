title: 2013-05-14 - Trainable Segmentation refactoring
categories: News
---

The original Trainable Segmentation library and plugins (Trainable Segmentation and Advanced Weka Segmentation) have been refactored for the sake of simplicity into a unified plugin and library called [Trainable Weka Segmentation](/plugins/tws).

The plugin is just a renaming of the former Advanced Weka Segmentation so it keeps complete backwards-compatibility. The old and unmaintained Trainable Segmentation plugin has been marked as deprecated and moved to {% include bc path='Plugins | Segmentation | deprecated'%}.
