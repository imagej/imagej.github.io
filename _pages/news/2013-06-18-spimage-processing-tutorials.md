title: 2013-06-18 - SPIMage processing tutorials
---

As part of Fiji's sister project - [OpenSPIM](/software/openspim)[^1] - we have assembled detailed step-by-step tutorials for [SPIMage processing](https://openspim.org/Operation#data-processing).

-   We start by defining [System requirements](https://openspim.org/Pre-requisites) and downloading [sample OpenSPIM data](https://openspim.org/Raw_data),
-   followed by optional [pre-processing steps](https://openspim.org/Pre-processing).
-   [Multi-view registration](https://openspim.org/Registration) is at the heart of SPIMage processing pipeline.
-   [Multi-view Fusion](https://openspim.org/Fusion) section discusses how to combine several view into one output image
-   [Time series registration](https://openspim.org/Timelapse_Registration) removes the sample drift across long-term timelapse.

The pipeline is relatively linear as described above, we highlight the steps where [alternative routes exist](https://openspim.org/Registration#cross-road-in-spim-plugins).
