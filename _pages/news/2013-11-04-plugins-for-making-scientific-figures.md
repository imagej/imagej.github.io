title: 2013-11-04 - Plugins for making scientific Figures
---

Writing papers and making figures is and always will be a big part of what scientists do. Many of us use open source software, such as Fiji, to process images however the figure is often finalised in commercial software - typically from Adobe. Needless to say neither Photoshop nor Illustrator are designed to make scientific figures.

Two groups have recently introduced plugins that leverage the tools available in ImageJ/Fiji to make scientific figures. Both tools are made by scientists introducing innovative concepts specifically designed to make scientific figure making easier and more controlled.

[FigureJ](http://imagejdocu.list.lu/doku.php?id=plugin:utilities:figurej:start) from *Jerome Mutterer* and [ScientiFig](http://srv-gred.u-clermont1.fr/labmirouse/software/) from *Benoit Aigouy* are well documented, open source ({% include github org='mutterer' repo='figurej' label='FigureJ' %} {% include github org='baigouy' repo='ScientiFig' label='ScientiFig' %}) and published:

{% include citation doi="10.1111/jmi.12069" %}

{% include citation doi="10.1038/nmeth.2692" %}

Each tool is available in Fiji through its own [Update Site](/list-of-update-sites).

Finally the OMERO team is also rolling out a Figure making plugin showcased here [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anJPPx7uoUM](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anJPPx7uoUM).

Making figures will never be the same.
