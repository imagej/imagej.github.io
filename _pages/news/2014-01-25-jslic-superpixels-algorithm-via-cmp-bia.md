title: 2014-01-25 - JSLIC Superpixels algorithm via CMP-BIA
---

Another contribution from professional computer vision researchers to Fiji is the [JSLIC superpixel](/plugins/cmp-bia-tools) algorithm recently contributed by [Jiri Borovec](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~borovji3/).

It is brought to you from the [Center for Machine Perception](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/) (CMP) which is a university research center performing fundamental and applied research in computer vision, robotics, machine learning, pattern recognition, and mathematics. Jiri is a member of the the [Biomedical Imaging Algorithms group](http://www.fel.cvut.cz/vv/tymy/mip.html) (BIA) headed by **Jan Kybic** who develops new algorithms for biomedical image processing. Thus **CMB-BIA** tools.

The CMP-BIA tools is a package for ImageJ/Fiji which will perform image segmentation and registration. For a fast integration of their plugins into Fiji you can use their own [update site](/list-of-update-sites).

We are exploiting here our Czech connections and are looking forward to many more cool tools coming to Fiji from CMP-BIA.
