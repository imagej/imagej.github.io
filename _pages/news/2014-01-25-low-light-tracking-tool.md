title: 2014-01-25 - Low Light Tracking Tool
---

**Alexander Krull** developed a [low light tracking tool](/plugins/low-light-tracking-tool) while working in [Iva Tolic-Norrelykke](http://www.mpi-cbg.de/en/research/research-groups/iva-tolic-norrelykke.html) lab at MPI-CBG.

The software is a tool for the tracking of low-light sub-resolution objects in fluorescent microscopy, but it can be applied in other fields as well. The plugin implements the localization algorithm described in the following paper:

Krull, A., Steinborn A., Ananthanarayanan V., Ramunno-Johnson D., Petersohn U., Tolic-Norrelykke I. M. **A divide and conquer strategy for the maximum likelihood localization of low intensity objects.** *Opt. express*, 22, no. 1, pp. 210-228, (2014)

As usual it is available through its own [update site](/list-of-update-sites).

Thanks to Alex for this great work and Iva for being such a steadfast supporter of Fiji.
