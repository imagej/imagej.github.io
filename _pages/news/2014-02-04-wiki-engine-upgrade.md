title: 2014-02-04 - Wiki engine upgrade
---

The Wiki engine was upgraded and the [VisualEditor](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/VisualEditor) extension (for in-place editing without having to know MediaWiki markup) was installed. If you encounter a bug, please feel free to describe it carefully in a mail to [the Fiji developers' mailing list](mailto:fiji@fiji.sc).

Enjoy!
