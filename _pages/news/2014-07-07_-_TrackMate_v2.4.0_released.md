We just released a new minor version of [TrackMate](/plugins/trackmate), that ships improvements to [TrackScheme](/plugins/trackmate/trackscheme) and bugfixes.

Improvements
------------

-   TrackScheme now has an outline panel, useful to navigate in large models.

-   TrackScheme has a better layout for tracks that have merge and split events.

<!-- -->

-   The 'Refresh' button on detector config panels is not present anymore. It's confusing and useless now that the quality value does not match pixel intensity at all.

<!-- -->

-   TrackMate has new logos and icons, made by Agnieszka Kawska @ [IlluScientia](http://www.illuscientia.com/).

Bugfixes
--------

-   Fixed several problems with the 'Copy Overlay' action.

<!-- -->

-   Fixed a severe TrackScheme bug, happening when creating links with invisible tracks.

<!-- -->

-   Fixed a detector crash when running a preview detection with 0 spots found.
