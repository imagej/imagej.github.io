Here is a status update from the ImageJ team at [LOCI](/orgs/loci): where we're at, what's next, and what tasks we see as the most important to keep ImageJ moving forward.

Top priority
------------

First and foremost, we're on the cusp of submitting a paper describing the structure of ImageJ2, which is a critical step towards future funding efforts.

On the technical side, {% include person content='Rueden' %} just wrote the first ImageJ code using Java 8 functionality, which will continue drive our {% include github org='imagej' repo='imagej' issue='135' label='need to migrate' %}. One recent and fundamental step in this direction is the release of the {% include list-of-update-sites content='3D update site' %}: providing Java 7- and 8-compatible versions of 3D ImageJ plugins (previously relegated to Java 6).

Next steps
----------

In the coming months we have several projects of interest. In approximate order of our priority:

-   [SCIFIO blockization](https://github.com/scifio/scifio/tree/blocks-are-so-plane) - better-integrating the [ImgLib2](/imglib2) data model and moving from Planes to a general block-based API
-   [Rich images](https://github.com/imagej/imagej-common/tree/rich-image) - a polishing pass at the ImageJ data model
-   [Robust-IO](https://github.com/scifio/scifio/tree/location-robust-io) - generalizing image I/O sources
-   Increasing the sophistication of [ImageJ Ops](/develop/imagej-ops)
-   [SciJava-Common 3.x](https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/milestones/3.0.0)
-   Increased collaboration with KNIME ([LOCI](/orgs/loci) is pleased to have {% include person content='gab1one' %} on loan from Konstanz!)
-   Improved {% include github org='imagej' repo='imagej-legacy' issue='86' label='ImageJ1-ImageJ2 synchronization' %}
-   [Formalizing developer roles and responsibilities](http://forum.imagej.net/t/project-developer-roles/206) (which will make an "Adopt-a-plugin" program possible!)

Long-term plans
---------------

-   Better support for arbitrarily large planes (via google-maps style scaling)
-   Improved support for arbitrarily large images (i.e., with huge numbers of planes or blocks)
-   JavaFX-based UI

Continued support
-----------------

While not directly tied to any one issue or reportable task, [LOCI](/orgs/loci) will continue to support:

-   The ImageJ communityâ€”especially with the success of the new [forum](http://forum.imagej.net/)
-   [LOCI](http://loci.wisc.edu/) scientific collaborations
-   Technical training, via continued [presentations, workshops](https://imagej.net/Presentations#Workshops) and wiki guides.
