And {% include person id='kephale' %} stopped by on the afternoon of the 23rd to discuss some issues for a bit.

## Discussions and progress

We spent the first couple of days discussing use cases and requirements for core [ImageJ2](/software/imagej2) metadata-rich image structures.

Some of the needed features we considered:

-   [ImageJ1](/software/imagej1) style calibration
-   Time space shearing
-   Transformations for display
-   Color conversion for display
-   Intensity conversion for display
-   Store preprocessed information about raw data (e.g.: min, max, histogram, features, ...)
-   Projections
-   Non-linear axes transformations (e.g.: log)
-   Other arbitrary transformations (e.g.: polar to cartesian)
-   Some informative strings (metadata)

The central use cases we used as litmus tests for our ideas:

-   Interpolate differently across different dimensions of an image (e.g.: treat XYZ as continuous with {% include javadoc project='ImgLib2' package='net/imglib2/interpolation/randomaccess' class='LanczosInterpolator' label='Lanczos' %}, but time as discrete with {% include javadoc project='ImgLib2' package='net/imglib2/interpolation/randomaccess' class='NearestNeighborInterpolator' label='nearest neighbor' %} or maybe {% include javadoc project='ImgLib2' package='net/imglib2/interpolation/randomaccess' class='NLinearInterpolator' label='1D linear' %}.
-   Register 2D tiles into a larger 2D image, a la [TrakEM2](/plugins/trakem2).
-   Register 2D planes over time (e.g.: correct for shaky cam).
-   Time skew over samples: each plane/scanline/pixel can have a physical timestamp, which could be taken into account somehow, although in practice doing so is very rare.

We spent quite some time considering how to create a unified data structure (`SpaceTree`? :-) which would keep multiple images grouped into some tree- or graph-like structure, with attached {% include javadoc project='ImgLib2' package='net/imglib2/realtransform' class='RealTransform' label='transforms' %}, in a way which handled all of the above use cases and more.

Ultimately, we concluded it was too difficult to design such a data structure in a vacuum, so we instead opted to start coding individual use cases using [ImgLib2](/libs/imglib2). We came up with a design which provides: A) a container for metadata-rich images, with individual metadata elements sensitive to {% include javadoc project='ImgLib2' package='net/imglib2/view' class='Views' %} manipulations; and B) a scheme for "grooming" these metadata-rich images into increasingly useful data structures depending on the use case.

### Metadata-rich containers

We invented `MetaViews`, a class analogous to {% include javadoc project='ImgLib2' package='net/imglib2/view' class='Views' %} but for metadata elements. These elements are then aggregated into a `MetaSpace`, which provides mutators and accessors for working with the space. For example, you might attach a physical calibration to a spatial axis, or a custom variable-width timestamp to each point along the time axis.

On top of this, we are actively developing a (tentatively named) `RichImage` structure, consisting of image pixels (e.g., a `RandomAccessible`) together with a `MetaSpace` which describes it. The [SCIFIO](/libs/scifio) library will be updated to produce a `Dataset`, a collection of `RichImage` elements, which are populated with elements directly from the source data format.

### Image enrichers

For the various use cases above (e.g., registration of tiles in a larger space), we will have a pipeline which calls `ImageInspector` plugins that examine the `RichImages` and decide whether they can be improved with available `ImageEnricher` plugins. (Again: these are working names only.) For instance, the `Dataset` image collection might consist of a bag of 2D tiles with associated affine transforms; a `MosaicEnricher` could then apply those transforms virtually to offer the larger 2D mosaic image as a `RandomAccessible` which returns lists of tile values at each sample. A `FusionEnricher` could operate on any `RandomAccessible` which returns a list, blending the values of that list using a given `Converter`. (In practice, the enrichers will very likely be more general than these examples, but hopefully they serve here to illustrate some of the possibilities.)
