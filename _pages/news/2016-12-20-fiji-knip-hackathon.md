### HongKee Moon

-   Separated BigDataServer into two versions. One is SimpleBigDataServer which can be launched by adding xml datasets in the command line. The other is (Advanced) BigDataServer which is running with H2 DBMS backend.
-   ER design is completed with {% include person id='tpietzsch' %}.
-   (Advanced) BigDataServer
    -   H2 DBMS integration is completed.
    -   User/Dataset/Tag/Annotation entity relationships are decided and made in the hackathon.
    -   DataSets are managed as either private or public according to users.
    -   Manager context is still supported as well as user management is possible there.
    -   Each user can share private datasets with other users.
-   SimpleBigDataServer
    -   This is almost same as the previous command line based BigDataServer.
-   Technical notes
    -   Upgraded the stringtemplate with v4(org.stringtemplate.v4.ST) which is getting powerful for templating strings for HTML tables.
    -   By using AJAX, database CRUD operations are carried in a responsive way.
    -   Realized how important JDBC database connection pool is.

## Technical discussions

### Programmers Anonymous

-   Robert is addicted to ImageJ.
-   Ulrik can only do snapshot releases.
-   Florian is doing too much at once... at least he has a car! (Yes Klim, you can join...)

### Stable releases of Fiji

-   We agreed to cut a stable release of Fiji once every six months.
    -   {% include person id='fjug' %} will manage the releases, both socially and technically.
    -   {% include person id='haesleinhuepf' %} will update the [Updater](/plugins/updater) to more clearly communicate the ramifications of updating.
    -   {% include person id='ctrueden' %} will create Jenkins jobs for automating cutting of stable release candidates and releases.
-   We agreed to continue pursuing the "melting pot" builds of Fiji and/or the SciJava universe, to better detect cross-component regressions and incompatibilities.
    -   {% include person id='ctrueden' %} will research effective approaches for running the melting pot via CI.
    -   Core maintainers (esp. {% include person id='tpietzsch' %} and {% include person id='axtimwalde' %}) will run the melting pot manually to vet its usefulness and correctness.

### 3D viewers in ImageJ and Fiji

-   We discussed how best to proceed with the [ThreeDViewer](/plugins/sciview), [BigDataViewer](/plugins/bdv) et. al.
    -   All agree to be very grumpy if the discussion ever degrades back to a laundry list of desired features (before we actually finish the first iteration of the code)
    -   {% include person id='kephale' %} will continue efforts to consolidate [ThreeDViewer](/plugins/sciview) and [BigDataViewer](/plugins/bdv) into a unified viewer
    -   {% include person id='tibuch' %} and {% include person id='dietzc' %} will continue to develop UI components for BDV and KNIME using SciJava for use in the unified viewer
    -   {% include person id='kephale' %}, {% include person id='tibuch' %}, and {% include person id='dietzc' %} will reconvene in the Spring for component integration
    -   {% include person id='tpietzsch' %} will continue to work his BDV magic
-   Roughly the idea is (we previously discussed this at the 2016 summer Konsanz hackathon):
    -   4 viewer panels (number of panels is convenience not hard coded): X-Y, Y-Z, X-Z, and 3D. Viewer panels have sliders for time and other dimensions
    -   Control panel with selection of attributes that can be synced between viewer panels, but can also be used for independent control of viewer panels
    -   BDV provides orthogonal views
    -   Viewer panels have overlays: minimaps, intensity, etc.
    -   ROI overlays can also be provided
    -   Panels are just JPanels
    -   {% include person id='tpietzsch' %} says most of the backend has already been developed in BDV
    -   [ThreeDViewer](/plugins/sciview) should reuse more of [BigDataViewer](/plugins/bdv)'s UI components
    -   GUI tools/widgets will go into scijava-ui-swing
    -   {% include person id='skalarproduktraum' %} will continue to develop Scenery for the core 3D rendering functionality
