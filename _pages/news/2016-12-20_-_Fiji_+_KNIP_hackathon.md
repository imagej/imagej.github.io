-   ER design is completed with {% include person content='Pietzsch' %}.

<!-- -->

-   (Advanced) BigDataServer
    -   H2 DBMS integration is completed.
    -   User/Dataset/Tag/Annotation entity relationships are decided and made in the hackathon.
    -   DataSets are managed as either private or public according to users.
    -   Manager context is still supported as well as user management is possible there.
    -   Each user can share private datasets with other users.

<!-- -->

-   SimpleBigDataServer
    -   This is almost same as the previous command line based BigDataServer.

<!-- -->

-   Technical notes
    -   Upgraded the stringtemplate with v4(org.stringtemplate.v4.ST) which is getting powerful for templating strings for HTML tables.
    -   By using AJAX, database CRUD operations are carried in a responsive way.
    -   Realized how important JDBC database connection pool is.

Technical discussions
---------------------

### Programmers Anonymous

-   Robert is addicted to ImageJ.
-   Ulrik can only do snapshot releases.
-   Florian is doing too much at once... at least he has a car! (Yes Klim, you can join...)

### Stable releases of Fiji

-   We agreed to cut a stable release of Fiji once every six months.
    -   {% include person content='Jug' %} will manage the releases, both socially and technically.
    -   {% include person content='Haesleinhuepf' %} will update the [Updater](/plugins/updater) to more clearly communicate the ramifications of updating.
    -   {% include person content='Rueden' %} will create Jenkins jobs for automating cutting of stable release candidates and releases.
-   We agreed to continue pursuing the "melting pot" builds of Fiji and/or the SciJava universe, to better detect cross-component regressions and incompatibilities.
    -   {% include person content='Rueden' %} will research effective approaches for running the melting pot via CI.
    -   Core maintainers (esp. {% include person content='Pietzsch' %} and {% include person content='Saalfeld' %}) will run the melting pot manually to vet its usefulness and correctness.

### 3D viewers in ImageJ and Fiji

-   We discussed how best to proceed with the [ThreeDViewer](/plugins/sciview), [BigDataViewer](BigDataViewer) et. al.
    -   All agree to be very grumpy if the discussion ever degrades back to a laundry list of desired features (before we actually finish the first iteration of the code)
    -   {% include person content='Kharrington' %} will continue efforts to consolidate [ThreeDViewer](/plugins/sciview) and [BigDataViewer](BigDataViewer) into a unified viewer
    -   {% include person content='tibuch' %} and {% include person content='Dietzc' %} will continue to develop UI components for BDV and KNIME using SciJava for use in the unified viewer
    -   {% include person content='Kharrington' %}, {% include person content='tibuch' %}, and {% include person content='Dietzc' %} will reconvene in the Spring for component integration
    -   {% include person content='Pietzsch' %} will continue to work his BDV magic
-   Roughly the idea is (we previously discussed this at the 2016 summer Konsanz hackathon):
    -   4 viewer panels (number of panels is convenience not hard coded): X-Y, Y-Z, X-Z, and 3D. Viewer panels have sliders for time and other dimensions
    -   Control panel with selection of attributes that can be synced between viewer panels, but can also be used for independent control of viewer panels
    -   BDV provides orthogonal views
    -   Viewer panels have overlays: minimaps, intensity, etc.
    -   ROI overlays can also be provided
    -   Panels are just JPanels
    -   {% include person content='Pietzsch' %} says most of the backend has already been developed in BDV
    -   [ThreeDViewer](/plugins/sciview) should reuse more of [BigDataViewer](BigDataViewer)'s UI components
    -   GUI tools/widgets will go into scijava-ui-swing
    -   {% include person content='skalarproduktraum' %} will continue to develop Scenery for the core 3D rendering functionality
