Over the past many months, we have been incrementally working toward support for HTTPS (i.e., secure) web traffic for ImageJ's web-based resources. At the [recent hackathon at MPI-CBG](/news/2016-12-20_-_Fiji_+_KNIP_hackathon), we largely completed these efforts. Some of the domains which now fully support HTTPS include:

-   https://imagej.net/
-   https://downloads.imagej.net/
-   https://javadoc.imagej.net/
-   https://jenkins.imagej.net/
-   https://maven.imagej.net/
-   https://mirror.imagej.net/
-   https://search.imagej.net/
-   https://sites.imagej.net/
-   https://status.imagej.net/
-   https://update.imagej.net/
-   https://wsr.imagej.net/
-   https://fiji.sc/
-   https://samples.fiji.sc/
-   https://update.fiji.sc/

More work is still needed to make the [ImageJ Updater](/plugins/updater) always prefer talking to update sites via HTTPS rather than HTTP; see [the relevant forum thread](http://forum.imagej.net/t/https-to-make-imagej-fiji-more-secure/398) for further details.

This work will make ImageJ and Fiji more secure, preventing potential man-in-the-middle attacks and arbitrary code injection.
