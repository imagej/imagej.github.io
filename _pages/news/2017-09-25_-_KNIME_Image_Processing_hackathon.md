---

From Wednesday, September 20, 2017 through Friday, September 28, 2017, {%- include person id='dietzc' -%} of [KNIME](https://www.knime.org) hosted \~20 developers at the [KNIME Konstanz Regional Office](https://www.knime.com/contact) for a [hackathon](/events/Hackathon) to develop the KNIME Image Processing extensions along with the underlying [ImageJ Ops](/libs/imagej-ops) library, as well as other related and/or supporting technologies such as [Ilastik](http://ilastik.org/), [ImgLib2](/imglib2) and [BigDataViewer](/plugins/bdv).

There was a big focus this time on machine learning, particularly deep learning networks applied to biological data.

Technical discussions
---------------------

-   Fiji component and application releases: today and in the future ({%- include person id='ctrueden' -%}, {%- include person id='fjug' -%}, {%- include person id='tpietzsch' -%})
    -   Next stable release (December 2017) will still follow the 'old' way of doing things.
    -   In case the DFG grant comes in and we hired the 2 people they will start implementing the new way of cutting stable releases. This will be great!
-   How to integrate ImageJ, KNIME and machine learning frameworks (particularly Keras and TensorFlow)
