From Wednesday, September 20, 2017 through Friday, September 28, 2017, {% include person content='Dietzc' %} of [KNIME](https://www.knime.org) hosted \~20 developers at the [KNIME Konstanz Regional Office](https://www.knime.com/contact) for a [hackathon](/events/Hackathon) to develop the KNIME Image Processing extensions along with the underlying [ImageJ Ops](/develop/imagej-ops) library, as well as other related and/or supporting technologies such as [Ilastik](http://ilastik.org/), [ImgLib2](/imglib2) and [BigDataViewer](BigDataViewer).

There was a big focus this time on machine learning, particularly deep learning networks applied to biological data.

### Florian Jug

-   Worked on a KNIME workflow that starts IsoNet-type deep nets on a image column. Works well now, but we want to move tiled executions out from python and move it into KNIME (and also Fiji). This follow-up work will be performed by {% include person content='frauzufall' %} and {% include person content='HedgehogCode' %}.
-   Received TGMM groin truth data an started working on Tr3d demo dataset.
-   Started working on min cell-cycle constraints for Tr2d. This will make the ILP explode...

-   Created a KNIME image processing plugin for image segmentation based on Labkit / Trainable Segmentation.

Technical discussions
---------------------

-   Fiji component and application releases: today and in the future ({% include person content='ctrueden' %}, {% include person content='fjug' %}, {% include person content='tpietzsch' %})
    -   Next stable release (December 2017) will still follow the 'old' way of doing things.
    -   In case the DFG grant comes in and we hired the 2 people they will start implementing the new way of cutting stable releases. This will be great!
-   How to integrate ImageJ, KNIME and machine learning frameworks (particularly Keras and TensorFlow)
