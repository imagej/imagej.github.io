Technical Discussions
---------------------

### N5, not HDF5

For more info on N5, check out the github repository [here](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5/).

-   feels like HDF5, but stores chunks(blocks) in separate files in the file system.
-   is a Java library, but Constantin Pape already wrote a C++/python version of it: z5 (also matches "zarr" library), https://github.com/constantinpape/z5
-   attributes are stored in an additional JSON file
-   Discussion: should we define standard now as to how data should be stored in there to prevent an emergence of a zoo of different flavors as there is for HDF5?
    -   how to do time series where each timestep / angle could have different image size
    -   if we want a general "N5 viewer" for images, we'd have to add calibration data
    -   put this information around the N5 dataset, because it behaves more like a dataset within an H5 file.
    -   Perhaps [make it versioned](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5/issues/15)? Because *a duck is not always a duck...*
-   why another file format?
    -   parallel writes (awesome for clusters with shared filesystem)
    -   there is a special type for label blocks
    -   blocks can have a halo
    -   the block grid does not need to be filled dense, some blocks could be missing
    -   couldn't this just be another flavor of HDF5?
-   are parallel writes to the same block prevented by some kind of locks?
-   the HDF5 team should be included in the discussions to learn from their mistakes - there is lots of information on parallel writing of HDF5 files out there
-   Try to write a N5 dataset into a FUSE filesystem/file??? Could this be a work-around for the many-small-files issue?

### BigDataViewer

-   There is a fork of BigDataViewer for JavaFx. [1](https://github.com/hanslovsky/bigdataviewer-core/tree/bigcat-javafx)
-   BigDataViewer will be splitted into a UI independent part, and the Swing UI. This will make it possible to merge the JavaFx and Swing Version of BigDataViewer .

We discussed opportunities to improvement for the Bdv design:

-   Slim the core of bdv, make it less smart and more predictable.
-   Bdv handle for different UI toolkits,
-   Use property pattern for settings like active source ...
-   Actively add/remove views
-   Update views (force cache-dropping) - for BDV add/remove views
-   Access to color settings, overlap rendering, …
-   Allow Grouping of views (externally is ok)
-   Consider Accumulator / Composite that works with type other than ARGBType
-   Make it easy to disable or replace Dialogs
-   Make it easy to remove an overlay
-   BdvVistools show function for converters/volatile

### Matrix and Vector libraries

-   Discussion notes: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12a_9AhFMJywm7y-SfZHuWB5cXwEkpCGt03Sxq8JVfMI/edit
-   Compared different matrix and vector libaries: https://github.com/imglib/imglib2-matrix-shootout
-   Conclusion:
    -   use ojAlgo for N-D matrix operations
    -   vector3 and vector4 is a complicated conclusion. probably use mastodon and JOML

### ImageJ/Fiji parallelization

-   initial focus on embarassingly parallel data
-   specific parallel (cluster) implementation will be abstracted
-   from the system architecture point of view, the design can be inspired by the search bar feature implementation
-   started use case definition

Hackathon Progress
------------------

### ilastik - (Dominik Kutra, Carsten Haubold)

-   developed an ImageJ2 plugin that allows to stream raw data and predictions from the *work in progress* ilastik processing backend: https://github.com/ilastik/org.ilastik.bdvsource
-   discussed with Philipp Hanslovsky about the benefits of using the N5 format for communication
    -   the label block format together with the fact that datasets can be stored sparse could be a great foundation for label storage / communication
    -   played around with [Constantin Pape's C++/Python N5](https://github.com/constantinpape/z5) reader as available format on the [ilastik server](https://github.com/ilastik/ilastik/tree/apistar-add-n5)
    -   noticed that the only thing needed to serve a N5 dataset on the web is to serve the directory contents. Philipp wrote a [N5 REST reader](https://github.com/hanslovsky/n5-rest) for BigCAT to talk to the ilastik server that way
-   worked on some caching problems in the *ilastik server*
-   discussed possible interfaces between Matthias Arzt's LabKit and ilastik-backend for interactive segmentation in ImageJ/BigDataViewer with an ilastik classifier backend

### SciView - (Kyle Harrington, Ulrik Günther, Curtis Rueden)

-   set up automatic deployment of Fiji update site that works on all operating sustems
-   imglib2 images as textures on 3D objects
-   imagej2-style logging
-   public availability of SciView plugin

### ImageJ server - (Curtis Rueden, Petr Bainar)

-   discussed its design with respect to the ImageJ/Fiji architecture as well as its future use cases
-   identified the most imminent issues, raised them on [GitHub](https://github.com/imagej/imagej-server/issues) and brainstormed possible solutions
-   worked on a new JavaScript client with enhanced UI, making use of the Angular framework
-   demoed the new client to the community
-   encouraged members of the community to use annotations specifying whether a SciJava plugin can run headless or not
