The Google Accelerated Science team has published an ImageJ plugin, [Microscope Focus Quality](Microscope_Focus_Quality), for assessing the focus quality of microscope images using a pretrained [TensorFlow](/software/tensorflow) model.

For details, see the Google Research Blog post [Using Deep Learning to Facilitate Scientific Image Analysis](https://research.googleblog.com/2018/03/using-deep-learning-to-facilitate.html), as well as the publication in BMC Bioinformatics:
