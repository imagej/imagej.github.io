From Monday, December 3, 2018 through Friday, December 7, 2018, the [Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics](https://mpi-cbg.de/) hosts \~10 developers at the [Center for Systems Biology](http://www.csbdresden.de/) in Dresden, Germany for a [hackathon](/events/Hackathon) to develop KNIME Image Processing and [ImageJ2](/software/imagej2)/[Fiji](/fiji) core infrastructure and [plugins](/fiji/plugins).

Gitter channel: https://gitter.im/juglab/Hack1812

Topics / Technical Discussions
------------------------------

### TensorFlow (Debo, Curtis, Benny)

-   Plan for TensorFlow: ship native libs both CPU and GPU in lib/<platform> directly;
-   TensorFlow update sites and reconcile to new TF version -- add tests

### SCIFIO (Gabriel, Curtis)

-   Create samples.scif.io, migrate LOCI samples, update scif.io website with a table of samples
-   Update scifio-bf-compat to split the mega-format into one per reader/writer

### Governance

-   Code of conduct - https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project/> - <http://openrespect.org/ (It's written by the author of The Art of Community)
-   Update fiji.sc, imagej.net/Fiji, etc. with revised maintainership info

Google Scholar: citation count badges on wiki pages

-   What to do about NanoJ using google analytics -- i.e. should we have usage stats?
    -   \[Action item\] Ask Ricardo Henriques about it
    -   Consider what to write onto code of conduct about what should be allowed

Meet at later point in timeâ€”and who is going to do it

-   What to do about the two different logos: ImageJ vs. Fiji
-   Upstream Java issues -- send something shortly after January 15
    -   \[Action item for Ulrik\] Writeup from Ulrik and Stephan S. about JavaFX
    -   \[Action item for Ulrik\] Writeup from Tobias about Unsafe

### Wiki

-   doi in maven pom
-   citation badge on wiki pages

### Servers (Gaby, Debo, Curtis)

-   Server infrastructure overview with Gaby

rsync mirror to pacific.mpi-cbg.de

### Labkit as Labeling Editor for KNIME Image Processing

-   Node for editing labels in KNIME based on [Labkit](/plugins/labkit) was created.
-   Work is not entirely finish. We plan to finish this work during the Ostrava Hackathon.
-   Labkit was extended, and is now able to handle multiple images.
-   A labeling datatype to store labels, and track modifications was developed.

### Simple ImageJ API

-   Discussion between: Deborah, Robert, Curtis, Matthias
-   How can we make the scripting in ImageJ2 easier?
-   Setup a table, of scripting examples in IJ1 and IJ2. Improve the IJ2 API where ever it's obviously required.
-   Write a SimpleIJ gateway, that provides really simple methods for the most frequent tasks in ImageJ.
-   A ImageJ2 script recorder could improve the IJ2 API, as it clearly shows where the API is to verbos.

### Big Data Server

-   Discussion Tobias, Gabriella and Matthias about a mechanism for secure user authentication in Big Data Server (and ImageJ Server).
-   It's needed by biologists, that want to share there data with specific users.
-   ImageJ Server would also benefit, if the access to the API could be authenticated in a similar way.

### Octtree Like, Compressed, Fast, Bitmaps for Imglib2

-   Tobias develops a data structure to store bitmap. For iteration, efficient pixels access and little memory foot print at the same time.
-   Such data structures can be used to better express labels in imglib2. Even instance segmentations that consist of millions of labels, can be accessed efficiently if a cell image like cache is used.

### HTTPS (Debo, Curtis, Gaby, Tobi)

-   HTTPS java-version-check
-   move list of update sites to a GitHub repository -- off the wiki

### Updater/Launcher (Debo, Curtis)

-   Add version to db.xml.gz schema
-   Make the updater smart enough to support serving maven artifacts
-   Migrate "make fiji package" to imagej updater
-   improve "make package" to only zip up non-update-site things ("online mode")
-   Eliminate native launcher in favor of javafx + java-launches-java scheme

### Plot Service (Matthias, Curtis)

-   Get it merged to scijava-common / scijava-ui-swing
-   https://forum.image.sc/t/error-noclassdeffounderror-net-imagej-table-table/21369/7

### Curtis

-   Merge script editor PRs

add "browse javadoc" and "browse source" options for selected code? e.g. on IOService opens DefaultIOService on GitHub or javadoc.scijava.org

-   Finish algorithms branch of imagej-mesh -- Move imagej-ops mesh package and algorithms into imagej-mesh -- See WIP commit message on algorithms branch -- Update imagej-ops to call migrated routines

### Other

-   Remove modern mode from GUI (Debo, Curtis)
-   Labkit + KNIME (Matthias, Tim-Oliver, others)
-   KNIME+TensorFlow+Server (Tim-Oliver, Benny)
-   Ilastik tracking (Carsten, Mangal)
-   Scenery + KNIME including BigVolumeViewer (Ulrik, Gabriel)
-   Image metadata (Carsten, Marcel)
