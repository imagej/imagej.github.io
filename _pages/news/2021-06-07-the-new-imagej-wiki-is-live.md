title: 2021-06-07 - The new ImageJ wiki is LIVE!
---

After [more than 10 months of effort](https://forum.image.sc/t/39672),
and a [week-long community sprint](/events/wiki-grand-opening),
the new ImageJ wiki has finally arrived! You're looking at it, baby!

[Many pages](/events/wiki-grand-opening/page-list)
still need to be vetted against the previous content.
If you want to help with that effort, please see the
[how to help](/events/wiki-grand-opening/how-to-help) guide.

We hope you enjoy the new wiki!
