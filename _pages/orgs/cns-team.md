# Chimeric Nano Sensor (CNS) Team

**About Us**
Established in late 2024 by **Dr. Kui Wang** at the Institute of Neuroscience (ION), CAS, the **Chimeric Nano Sensor (CNS) Team** is a dynamic and collaborative hub of young talents recruited from across China and around the globe. We are a highly capable, energetic group united by a shared passion for scientific discovery and a dedication to advancing sensor development and *in vivo* imaging.

**🔬 Research Focus**
Our research centers on visualizing the invisible dynamics of life. We engineer next-generation **genetically encoded and chemogenetic biosensors** and apply them to study physiological processes (such as metabolism and neuromodulation) in live animal models.

**💻 Open-Source Software**
Beyond wet-lab innovation, we develop a comprehensive suite of computational tools to facilitate image analysis:

* **Standalone Software**:
  * [**RIA**](https://pypi.org/project/ria-gui/): Ratio Imaging Analyzer (Python/GUI).
* **ImageJ/Fiji Plugins (Biosensor Tools)**:
  * [**RIA-J**](https://imagej.net/plugins/biosensor/ria-j): Publication-grade ratiometric analysis.
  * [**FIA**](https://imagej.net/plugins/biosensor/fia): Robust fluorescence image alignment.
  * [**MIA**](https://imagej.net/plugins/biosensor/mia): Metadata inspection and extraction.
  * [**NIA**](https://imagej.net/plugins/biosensor/nia): Native AI-powered denoising.
  * [**WinMan**](https://imagej.net/plugins/biosensor/winman): Workspace and window management.
