The Dresden Analysis-of-Images Suite
([DAIS](http://dais.bioimagecomputing.com)) is a partner project of
[CIBI](https://www.denbi.de/network/center-for-integrative-bioinformatics-cibi/21-about/508-portfolio-of-center-for-integrative-bioinformatics-cibi)
in the German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure
([de.NBI)](https://www.denbi.de). The [Fiji](/software/fiji) community is
actively working towards tight integration with the [KNIME](/software/knime)
workflow engine, which is maintained and developed by the de.NBI center CIBI.
DAIS has a strong focus on further strengthening interoperability and
integration of Fiji and KNIME, as well as bringing together their respective
developer communities.
