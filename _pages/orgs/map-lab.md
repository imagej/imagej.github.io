Research in the lab addresses the molecular basis of drug addiction. We focus
on the functional organization and regulation of neurotransmitter signaling
pathways mediated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Emerging data
indicate that the sub cellular localization of GPCRs is a critical determinant
of their signaling. We have developed state-of-the-art fluorescence imaging
approaches to precisely track the location and signaling of these GPCRs in real
time in living neurons. Using these approaches, we study the fundamental cell
biological mechanisms linking GPCR trafficking to signaling, and how these
mechanisms are perturbed in addiction and neuropsychiatric disorders.
