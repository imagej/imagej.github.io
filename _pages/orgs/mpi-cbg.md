The [Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics (MPI-CBG)](http://www.mpi-cbg.de) is a research institute in Dresden, Germany, pioneering basic research. 500 curiosity-driven scientists from over 50 countries collectively ask: How do cells form tissues? Hence, the research programs at the MPI-CBG span multiple scales of magnitude, from molecular assemblies to organelles, cells, tissues, organs, and organisms.

The MPI-CBG is also the place where the [Fiji](/software/fiji) project was started and is still one of the key contributors to Fiji and its supporting infrastructure.
