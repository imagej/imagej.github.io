## About Us

We are a research group at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ontario. The
focus of our research is on the molecular mechanisms involved in aging and
longevity. Mitochondria, via their contribution to energy metabolism, cell
death pathways, and redox-regulated signal transduction pathways, are thought
to be important effectors of longevity. We use a comparative approach to study
these in mammalian species, including those that are exceptionally long-lived.
We are also exploring the ability of small molecules including selective
estrogen receptor modulators and phytoestrogens to modulate mitochondrial
function and affect aging and longevity.
