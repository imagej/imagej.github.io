Albert Cardona is an MRC Investigator (Programme Leader) at the [MRC Laboratory for Molecular Biology](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/group-leaders/a-to-g/albert-cardona/) and at the [University of Cambridge](http://www.pdn.cam.ac.uk/directory/albert-cardona), UK. My interests are mostly in comparative and experimental connectomics, that is, mapping the synaptic wiring diagram of the central nervous system (the "brain") of numerous animals, in search of fundamental principles of neural circuit architecture and their relationship to neural function and behavior.

Albert Cardona is the founding author of [TrakEM2](/plugins/trakem2) and of [Fiji](https://fiji.sc), and contributed to many software libraries and documentation efforts primarily within ImageJ and Fiji.

Albert Cardona writes and mantains the [Fiji Python Scripting Tutorial](https://syn.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/acardona/fiji-tutorial/) for scripting Fiji with python on the JVM [Jython](https://www.jython.org/).
