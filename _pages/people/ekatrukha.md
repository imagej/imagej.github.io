I like coding, algorithms, data structures and microtubules.  

So I develop and maintain many open-source plugins, in the various areas where scientific curiosity takes me.   

Last couple of years I'm into 3D and large data.   
The most recent project I'm working on right now is [BigVolumeBrowser](/plugins/bigvolumebrowser).   

My other plugins:  
- curve (filaments, microtubules) tracing in 3D [BigTrace](/plugins/bigtrace) and in 2D [CurveTrace](https://github.com/UU-cellbiology/CurveTrace); 
- spots detection/colocalization [ComDet](/plugins/spots-colocalization-comdet); 
- localization microscopy data analysis [DoM_Utrecht](https://github.com/UU-cellbiology/DoM_Utrecht) (drift, chromatic aberration correction, 3D, tracking);
- kymographs of arbitrary width, projection and data type [KymoResliceWide](/plugins/kymoreslicewide);
- iterative averaging of arbitrary 2D/3D/4D multi-channel datasets [AveragingND](https://github.com/UU-cellbiology/AveragingND);
- spatio-temporal correlations [Correlescence](https://github.com/UU-cellbiology/Correlescence) (STICS, TICS and etc);
- FLIM data analysis [PTU_Reader](https://github.com/UU-cellbiology/PTU_Reader) and [PTU_Writer](https://github.com/ekatrukha/PTU_Writer);
- combining or making montage from tiffs of different sizes [UnequalTiffs](https://github.com/ekatrukha/UnequalTiffs);
- color-coding z-stacks [ZstackDepthColorCode](https://github.com/UU-cellbiology/ZstackDepthColorCode);
- generating [ContourLines](https://github.com/UU-cellbiology/ContourLines);
- fast virtual reading of hyperstacks from [Metamorph](https://github.com/ekatrukha/Metamorph_nD_5D).

And then there are multiple macros and some contributions to other projects.   

I work at the [Cell Biology, Neurobiology and Biophysics](https://cellbiology.science.uu.nl/) department of Utrecht University, NL.
