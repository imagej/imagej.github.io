I like coding, algorithms, data structures, and microtubules.  

Currently, I work at the [Cell Biology, Neurobiology and Biophysics](https://cellbiology.science.uu.nl/) department of Utrecht University, NL.  

You can check my scientific output in a nicely formatted [papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=FfzP1wwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

My main scientific interest is the organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton.   
It took me to the areas of advanced microscopy, cell biology, biophysical modeling, and image analysis.   
I am big fan of open data/code/papers, therefore I develop and maintain many open-source plugins.   

The last couple of years, I'm into 3D and large data.   
The most recent project I'm working on right now is [BigVolumeBrowser](/plugins/bigvolumebrowser).   

My other plugins:  
- curve (filaments, microtubules) tracing in 3D [BigTrace](/plugins/bigtrace) and in 2D [CurveTrace](https://github.com/UU-cellbiology/CurveTrace); 
- spots detection/colocalization [ComDet](/plugins/spots-colocalization-comdet); 
- localization microscopy data analysis [DoM_Utrecht](https://github.com/UU-cellbiology/DoM_Utrecht) (drift, chromatic aberration correction, 3D, tracking);
- kymographs of arbitrary width, projection and data type [KymoResliceWide](/plugins/kymoreslicewide);
- iterative averaging of arbitrary 2D/3D/4D multi-channel datasets [AveragingND](https://github.com/UU-cellbiology/AveragingND);
- spatio-temporal correlations [Correlescence](https://github.com/UU-cellbiology/Correlescence) (STICS, TICS and etc);
- FLIM data analysis [PTU_Reader](https://github.com/UU-cellbiology/PTU_Reader) and [PTU_Writer](https://github.com/ekatrukha/PTU_Writer);
- combining or making montage from tiffs of different sizes [UnequalTiffs](https://github.com/ekatrukha/UnequalTiffs);
- color-coding z-stacks [ZstackDepthColorCode](https://github.com/UU-cellbiology/ZstackDepthColorCode);
- generating [ContourLines](https://github.com/UU-cellbiology/ContourLines);
- fast virtual reading of hyperstacks from [Metamorph](https://github.com/ekatrukha/Metamorph_nD_5D).

And then there are multiple macros and some contributions to other projects.
