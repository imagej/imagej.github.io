Hello! I am a Systems Analyst at The Jackson Laboratory, working in the Research IT department. My expertise is in microscopy data analysis and management, with my previous life being the data person at [CAMDU](https://www.warwick.ac.uk/camdu).

I do not maintain any ImageJ plugins but I use it a lot! :)
