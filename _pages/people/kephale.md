Kyle Harrington developed the [FunImageJ](/software/funimagej) plugin to facilitate concise [Clojure](/scripting/clojure) code, which is also an easy way to write standalone [ImageJ2](/software/imagej2)/[ImgLib2](/libs/imglib2)-based programs in Clojure.

Kyle is also a developer on the [SciView](/plugins/sciview) project for development of a replacement 3D visualization tool for [ImageJ2](/software/imagej2) and [KNIME](/software/knime).
