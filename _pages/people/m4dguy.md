I studied Bioinformatics at Saarland University where I learned about ImageJ from his colleagues in the department of Biophyics.  
While I was working as a developer for web platforms at the [LCSB](http://wwwen.uni.lu/lcsb/research/bioinformatics_core/), I satisfied my passion for anything image analysis-related in my spare time.  
Intending to close the gap between [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) and ImageJ, I developed the plugin [CVForge](https://github.com/m4dguy/CVForge) which is currently in maintenance mode.  
At the moment, I work at the [Geodetic Institute](http://www.gia.rwth-aachen.de/) of RWTH Aachen where I process and analyze point cloud and imaging data.
