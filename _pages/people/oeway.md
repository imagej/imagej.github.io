I am currently a researcher at Science for Life Laboratory and KTH Royal Insitute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden. I joined the Cell Profiling group since Jan. 2019, mainly working on developing new methods for image analysis and modeling, mostly based on deep learning.

I obtained my Ph.D at Institut Pasteur, Paris where I developed deep learning based methods for advanced microscopy imaging.
