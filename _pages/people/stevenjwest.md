Here are some details of software packages contributed by Steven J. West.

## StereoMate Package

The StereoMate Package facilitates Stereological and Automated analysis of
confocal image stacks.

## Multi-OTSU

The Multi-OTSU algorithm is based on the
[Multi_Otsu_Threshold](/plugins/multi-otsu-threshold) algorithm contributed by
Yasunari Tosa. It has been modified to work on image stacks, and to directly
modify the image, so that it can be used with the StereoMate Threshold Manager
plugin.
