## HiDPI displays

If text and other UI elements appear tiny on your {% include wikipedia title='HiDPI' text='HiDPI'%} display, then check the following:

-   [Double check that you are running the 64-bit version of Java](/help/troubleshooting#checking-the-java-version).
-   Verify that you are running Windows 10 (Windows 7 and 8 do not do HiDPI scaling).
-   In {% include bc path='ImageJ.exe|Properties|Compatibility'%}, check the "Disable display scaling on high DPI settings" option. Try with it enabled, as well as disabled—some users have reported success only with this option *off*, and others only with it *on*.
