How to work with surface plots
------------------------------

You can download example source code for this HowTo [here](/plugins/3d-viewer/example-code).

Before reading this HowTo, it may be helpful to read [The relation between Content and Universe](/plugins/3d-viewer/content-structure).

Surface plots show a 2D image as a 3D plot, where the 3rd dimension is given by the intensity.

Because only one slice of an image stack can be displayed a time, `SurfacePlot2D` offers a method to set the displayed slice:

        // Add the image as a volume
        Content c = univ.addSurfacePlot(imp);


        // Retrieve the SurfacePlotGroup
        SurfacePlotGroup splot = (SurfacePlotGroup)c.getContent();

        // Scroll through the slices
        for(int i = 0; i &lt; 15; i++) {
            splot.setSlice(i + 1);

        }
