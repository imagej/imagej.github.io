# Overview
Skeletal ciliopathies are a group of disorders caused by dysfunction of the cilium, a small signaling organelle present on nearly every vertebrate cell. The cell-based assay consists of three parameters; (1) ciliogenesis, (2) cilium length and (3) retrograde intraflagellar transport (IFT). The ALPACA macro suite is able to quantify these parameters.
