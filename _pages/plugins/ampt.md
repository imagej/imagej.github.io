 The [Aquatic Mammal Photogrammetry Tool](https://allenmli.github.io/AMPT/) (AMPT) is an ImageJ plug-in that simplifies the process of measuring aquatic mammals from aerial imagery. The tool may be configured to support different guided measurements.

 AMPT has been developed by the Allen Machine Learning Impact Team at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, and we are looking for new collaborators. If you are interested in marine mammal photogrammetry, or are interested in collaborating please contact us at [ampt-dev@allenai.org](mailto:ampt-dev@allenai.org).
