The [Aquatic Mammal Photogrammetry Tool](https://allenmli.github.io/AMPT/) (AMPT) is an ImageJ plug-in that simplifies the process of measuring aquatic mammals from aerial imagery. The tool may be configured to support different guided measurements.

As of December 15, 2023 AMPT is no longer supported. If you are interested in taking the development and support of AMPT, please contact us at [ampt-dev@allenai.org](mailto:ampt-dev@allenai.org).

AMPT has been developed by the Allen Machine Learning Impact Team at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, and we are looking for new maintainers. If you are interested in maintaining and developing AMPT please contact us at [ampt-dev@allenai.org](mailto:ampt-dev@allenai.org).
