Purpose
-------

This is an example JRuby script, which is described in the page on [JRuby Scripting](JRuby_Scripting#Example__Generating_Red.2FCyan_Anaglyphs).

Code
----

    # The excessive comments are because this is supposed to be a helpful
    # example :)

    # This is the total angle between the two views that the 3D image is
    # constructed from.  You probably want to tweak this to get the angle
    # right for your presentation (e.g. depending on how large the screen
    # is, and how far away people will be...)

    degree_separation = 4

    # Find the current image:

    i = getImage

    # Some preliminary checks:

    if i.getStackSize == 1
      ij.IJ.error "This script only works on image stacks"
      return
    end

    unless i.getBitDepth == 8
      ij.IJ.error "This script only works on 8 bit image stacks"
      return
    end

    # Use the "3D Project..." (ij.plugin.filter.Projector) plugin to
    # generate an image stack with two slices, each containing a view of
    # the stack from a slightly different angle:

    projection_options = "projection=[Brightest Point] axis=Y-Axis "
    projection_options += "initial=-#{degree_separation / 2} "
    projection_options += "total=#{degree_separation} "
    projection_options += "rotation=#{degree_separation} "
    projection_options += "interpolate"

    run "3D Project...", projection_options

    # Operate on the generated window:

    # (It's an inelegance typical of writing macros such as these that one
    # has to discover the particular method the algorithm used to generate
    # the name of the new ImagePlus.)

    projections_title = "Projections of " + i.getShortTitle
    select_window projections_title

    # Split the stack into separate images, so we can merge them as
    # different colours:

    run "Stack to Images"

    # The images generated by that have predicatable names (see the
    # similar note above).  Use "RGB Merge..." to merge them:

    merge_options = "red=Projections-0001 "
    merge_options += "green=Projections-0002 "
    merge_options += "blue=Projections-0002 "
    merge_options += "gray=*None*"

    run "RGB Merge...", merge_options
