## [Full Documentation](https://labmus-ufrj.github.io/Animove/)

The documentation containing detailed usage for each function, example files, expected outputs and more is available at [this website](https://labmus-ufrj.github.io/Animove/).

## Goals

This plugin aims to make it possible to process large amounts of video data with low-spec hardware, specifically to quantify and analyze zebrafish kinetic activity with a diversity of parameters and outputs.

## Features

Using Fiji as its backbone, it inherits its multi-platform capabilities. Bytedeco's JavaCPP Presets for FFmpeg and OpenCV makes the low-RAM processing possible, here implemented with the necessary graphical interfaces and integrations with ImageJ's codebase.
