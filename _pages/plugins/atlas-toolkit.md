These 2D elastic registrations are powered by the [BUnwarpJ](/plugins/bunwarpj) plugin, and registration is guided by the gross morphology of the corresponding 3D objects, which can be defined using the [Segmentation Editor](/plugins/segmentation-editor) plugin.

Installation of the plugin
--------------------------

The plugin can be quickly installed via the project's update site. Please refer to the [ **tutorial**](/update-sites) on how to add our update site to your Fiji installation. Our update site has the following URL:

What's in the toolkit?
----------------------

Atlas Toolkit includes a number of different tools to help building atlases. Many of these will be of limited use/interest.

For those interested in 3D image registration, the most important tools will be [Label Registration 3D](#Label_Registration_3D "wikilink") and [Apply Label Registration](#Apply_Label_Registration "wikilink").

The complete list of tools is as follows:

-   Extract Nuclear Signal

<!-- -->

-   Project to Segment Label

<!-- -->

-   [Label Registration 3D](#Label_Registration_3D "wikilink")

<!-- -->

-   [Apply Label Registration](#Apply_Label_Registration "wikilink")

<!-- -->

-   Merge Registered Volumes

<!-- -->

-   Sample Volumes for Clustering

<!-- -->

-   Cluster Viewer
