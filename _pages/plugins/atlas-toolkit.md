The Atlas Toolkit plugin is a collection of tools developed to achieve group-wise elastic registration of 3D objects by decomposing the alignment problem into a sequence of orthogonal 2D elastic registrations, for which each object is registered to every other. These 2D elastic registrations are powered by the [BUnwarpJ](/plugins/bunwarpj) plugin, and registration is guided by the gross morphology of the corresponding 3D objects, which can be defined using the [Segmentation Editor](/plugins/segmentation-editor) plugin.

## Installation of the plugin

The plugin can be quickly installed via the project's update site. Please refer to the [ **tutorial**](/update-sites) on how to add our update site to your Fiji installation. Our update site has the following URL:

` `**`http://sites.imagej.net/GrocottLab/`**

## What's in the toolkit?

Atlas Toolkit includes a number of different tools to help building atlases. Many of these will be of limited use/interest.

For those interested in 3D image registration, the most important tools will be [Label Registration 3D](#label-registration-3d) and [Apply Label Registration](#apply-label-registration).

The complete list of tools is as follows:

-   Extract Nuclear Signal

<!-- -->

-   Project to Segment Label

<!-- -->

-   [Label Registration 3D](#label-registration-3d)

<!-- -->

-   [Apply Label Registration](#apply-label-registration)

<!-- -->

-   Merge Registered Volumes

<!-- -->

-   Sample Volumes for Clustering

<!-- -->

-   Cluster Viewer
