When clicking {% include bc path='Plugins|BigStitcher| BigStitcher'%} in the the Fiji menu, it will open a macro-scriptable dialog that looks as following:

![](/media/plugins/bigstitcher/bigstitcher-import-exisitng-0.png)

You have several options of how you can select your XML dataset file:

-   Drag & drop the XML file in there (e.g. from Explorer/Finder/...)
-   Use the file chooser (click **Browse ...**) to select the XML file
-   Type or copy & paste the full path of the XML file

If the XML file was successfully recognized, the dialog will change and show a quick summary of the contents of the dataset (the number of views, attributes, etc...) in <span style='color:#008000'>green</span>:

If there was an error parsing the XML file or the XML file doesn't exist the dialog will show respective warnings and errors. Finally just click **OK** and the BigStitcher window will appear.
