Special Dataset Importers
=========================

In addition to the more generic [Automatic Loader](/plugins/bigstitcher/autoloader) and [Stack loaders](/plugins/bigstitcher/stackloader), we also offer single-purpose loaders for images acquired on a **Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1** or a **diSPIM** controlled via **MicroManager**.

Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1 Dataset (Bioformats)
-----------------------------------------

{% include thumbnail src='/media/BigStitcher CZI Import1.png' title='Step 1: select the .czi file to load.'%}

If you select to load a **Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1 Dataset**, you will first be asked for the first **.czi-file** in the dataset (Step 1). If your dataset is just a single file, pick that file. If your dataset consists of multiple files, pick the one without a numeric suffix.

{% include thumbnail src='/media/BigStitcher CZI Import2.png' title='Step 2: Reviewing metadata detected in CZI-dataset.'%}

We will then parse the dataset and show the metadata we could extract in the next dialog (Step 2). There are a few changes you can make at this moment:

-   The Angle, Tiles, Channels, Illumination Directions and Time Points that were detected in the dataset will be shown and you can rename them.
-   The calibration (pixel distances) will be shown. You can select **Modify calibration** to change it manually in the next step.
-   The **rotation axis** of a multi-Angle dataset will be shown at the bottom of the dialog.
    -   Ticking **Modify rotation axis** will let you choose the axis manually in the next step.
    -   Ticking **Apply rotation to dataset** will transform the individual views according to the rotations from metadata. This should give you a rough alignment to start with.
-   Finally, due to a bug in BioFormats, all stacks in a file may be reported to have the same number of z-slices even if their number of slices differ (smaller stacks will be filled with zeroes to reach the size of the largest stack). If you tick **Fix Bioformats stack size bug**, we will inspect the image data and remove the zero-valued volume at the end of the stack.

{% include thumbnail src='/media/BigStitcher CZI Import3.png' title='Step 3: Modifying calibration and rotation axis.'%}

If you chose to modify the calibration or the rotation axis, a third dialog will be displayed in which you can manually set the following thinks (Step 3):

-   The pixel distance in every dimension (x,y and z).
-   The unit the pixel distance is measured in.
-   Which axis the different acquisition angles are rotated around.

After working through these steps, your dataset will be opened in [BigStitcher](/plugins/bigstitcher).
