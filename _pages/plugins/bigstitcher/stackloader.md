Stack-based dataset import
--------------------------

See also: the [dataset definition documentation](/plugins/mvr-definedataset) in [Multiview-Reconstruction](/plugins/multiview-reconstruction).

The **Manual Loader (Bioformats)** and **Manual Loader (TIFF Only, ImageJ Opener)** provide a robust way of importing datasets into BigStitcher. They allow you to manually specify the contents of a set of files and combine them into a dataset.

### Step 1: Defining what to look for

In the first dialog, you can specify which attributes (time points, channels, illumination direction, acquisition angle, tile) the single image stacks in your dataset have. For each attribute, you have to select if you have multiple instances or not.

When using the **Manual Loader (Bioformats)**, we also support one file to contain multiple instances (e.g. all channels in one file)

### Step 2: File pattern and additional options

#### File pattern

{% include thumbnail src='/media/BigStitcher Stack Import2.png' title='Step 2: Defining file pattern and additional options.'%}

In the next dialog, you will be asked to specify the **Image File directory**, i.e. the directory that contain all the files to include in the dataset.

You will also be asked for an **Image File Pattern** with placeholders for the actual attribute indices. For all attributes for which you specified **YES (one file per ... )** in the previous dialog, you have to include a placeholder in curly brackets:

-   `{t}` for time points
-   `{c}` for channels
-   `{i}` for illumination directions
-   `{a}` for angles
-   `{x}` for tiles

If your attribute indices always have a defined length in the filename , e.g. angles `000, 090, 180, ...`, you can specify that length by repeating the placeholder e.g. `{aaa}` for 3-digit angle index.

Next, you have to specify the actual indices for all the attributes. You can do this in two ways:

-   just list them, separated by commas. e.g.: `18,19,30`
-   specify a *range* in the form: `start-end[:step]`. e.g. `0-315:45` will produce `0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315`

For attributes for which you selected **YES (all ... in one file)**, please set the range to `0-(number of instances - 1)`, e.g. `0-2` for 3 channels.

#### other options

Furthermore, you can specify the **Calibration Type** i.e. whether the voxel size is the same for all views or different for each one.

Then, you can specify the method of *' Calibration Definition*', i.e. whether to load voxel sizes from file metadata, manually define them or load from files and display for manual verification.

You can choose which **ImgLib2 data container** to use. This is explained in detail in the dialog, but as a rule of thumb, use **ArrayImg** if all single images in the dataset are smaller than \~ 2 gigavoxels (width \* height \* depth) and **CellImg** if any one of them is bigger.

#### verification of files

Finally, you can choose to **Show list of filenames**. If you select this and press **OK**, we will list all the files you specified via the pattern in a new dialog (indicating whether they actually exist or not) and allow you to manually deselect some of them. Deselecting a file will mark the corresponding view in the dataset as **missing**. You can use this to ignore specific parts of the data, e.g. time points at which the sample moved, etc.

### Step 3: Verify calibration

If you chose to manually specify the voxel sizes or load them from metadata and display for verification, you can modify them in the next dialog. If you opted to use a different voxel size for each view, you can set the pixel distances and units for each view in this dialog, otherwise, one calibration will be used for all.

Once you click **OK**, your dataset should be displayed in the [BigStitcher main window](/plugins/bigstitcher/stitching-mode).
