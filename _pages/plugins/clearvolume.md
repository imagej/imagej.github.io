Help us doing so by letting us know if you encounter problems.

-   **Problem:** on a Linux machine ClearVolume would not start but throw an ugly exception like

    `java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError at clearvolume.renderer.opencl.OpenCLAvailability...`.
-   **Solution:** you might not have OpenCL installed or your installation is corrupted.

    On Ubuntu the following instructions turned out to be useful for some of our users: [http://askubuntu.com/questions/541114/how-to-make-opencl-work-on-14-10-nvidia-331-89-drivers](http://askubuntu.com/questions/541114/how-to-make-opencl-work-on-14-10-nvidia-331-89-drivers)

-   **Problem:** on a Mac, after ClearVolume opens in Fiji I see a large grey area where the 3D viewer should be.
-   **Solution:** we work on a fix... so far, double click on the grey area to switch to full screen, then double click again to go back to window mode.
