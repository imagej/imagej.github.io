## Purpose

Sets the thresholds for colocalization analysis, and also calculates Manders coefficients, 2D histogram / scatter plot, and other stats.

## Documentation

See the great documentation for this plugin at [Colocalization Analysis\#Colocalization\_Threshold](/imaging/colocalization-analysis#colocalization-threshold). The method is that implemented in Costes et al. This uses a Pearson's correlation above and below the thresholds to iteratively find where the correlation between the two images is 0 and sets the thresholds there. It is pretty robust and importantly is reproducible and non subjective.

Use of this plugin should be followed by use of the [Colocalization Test](/plugins/colocalization-test) plugin, to see of the results are statistically significant and better then random overlap of the signal in the images.

See also the [Colocalization Analysis](/imaging/colocalization-analysis) tutorial.
