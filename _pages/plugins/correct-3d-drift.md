{% include component-stats content='sc.fiji:Correct\_3D\_Drift' %}This Fiji menu command is implemented by the script {% include github org='fiji' repo='Correct\_3D\_Drift' path='src/main/resources/scripts/Plugins/Registration/Correct\_3D\_drift.py' label='Correct\_3D\_Drift.py' %}.

1.  The script expects the currently open and active image to be a hyperstack (or virtual hyperstack) consisting of 2D or 3D volumes over time. The script registers the time points to each other using the phase correlation implementation of [ImgLib 1](/imglib1).
2.  Once implemented a dialogue box will request the use to select the color channel to use for registration.
3.  If memory is limiting on the system then the user can select to use a virtualstack for the result.
4.  If a virtualstack is selected the a folder save the aligned stack to needs to be selected.
5.  After some processing (there are progress bars), the resulting, registered volumes are opened. If a virtualstack was selected the registered volume will already be saved in the chosen target folder.

The script was originally written by {% include person content='Albertcardona' %} and [Robert Bryson-Richardson](http://monash.edu/science/about/schools/biological-sciences/staff/bryson-richardson/) while attending the [Developmental Imaging EMBO course](http://cwp.embo.org/pc10-37/) organized by [Gabriel](http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/research/photo/556/) [G. Martins](http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/research/unit/51).
