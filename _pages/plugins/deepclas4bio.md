title: DeepClas4Bio
---

DeepClas4Bio is a project that aims to facilitate the interoperability of bioimaging tools with deep learning frameworks. In particular, DeepClas4Bio is an extensible API that provides a common access point for classification models of several deep learning frameworks. The source code and several examples of this project can be found in the [GitHub page of DeepClas4Bio](https://github.com/adines/DeepClas4Bio)

DeepClas4BioIJ has been built on top of [SciJava Common](/libs/scijava-common) using SciJava Commands.

Some ImageJ plugins to use this API have been developed and can be downloaded using the [ImageJ Update Site](http://sites.imagej.net/Adines/)
