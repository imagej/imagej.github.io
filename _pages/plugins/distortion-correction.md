## Purpose

This plugin can be used to estimate nonlinear distortions induced by the image
acquisition process[^1] . It does not require special calibration samples, but
needs sufficient overlapping image areas with preferably high contrast. For
further information on how to best arrange calibration images please see the
documentation.
