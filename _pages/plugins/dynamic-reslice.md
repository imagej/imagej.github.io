Purpose
-------

This plugin is simply a dynamic version of the Reslice command as it is in ImageJ version 1.42l, by Patrick Kelly, Harvey Karten, {% include person content='Rasband' %}, Julian Cooper and Adrian Deerr. It draws an orthogonal slice through the volume represented by the stack it is applied on along its ROI, and update dynamically this slice as the ROI is displaced or deformed.

Installation
------------

### ImageJ

Download the jar file [Dynamic\_Reslice.jar](https://fiji.sc/tinevez/Dynamic_Reslice.jar) and drop it into the *plugins* menu. The plugin will appear in the {% include bc path='Plugins | Dynamic\_Reslice'%} menu.

### Fiji

The plugin is part of the Fiji distribution, as a member of the [Fiji\_Plugins](/plugins/fiji-plugins) package. You can find it in the {% include bc path='Image | Stacks'%} menu.

Usage
-----

Open a stack and draw a line roi on it (any line roi will do it: straight line, poly-line, freehand line). When you call the plugin you are asked for two parameters.

-   *Flip vertically* will cause the source slices to be processed from bottom to top.
-   *Rotate 90°* will cause the result display to be rotated by 90°.

The reslice window is drawn. Now change the roi shape or move it with the mouse. The result window refreshes automatically. Is is possible to change roi type on the fly.

Scripting
---------

It is possible to call and control this plugin from other plugin or scripts. Here is a script example for use with [Fiji](/fiji).

```python
'''
This jython script intends at demonstrating how to script the 
Dynamic_Reslice plugin. It will open the t1-head sample stack
in Fiji, draw a ROI on it, and animate it while updating the 
Reslice image.

import fiji
import time

xstart = 40
ystart = 50


# Fetch the t1-head stack from URL
source_imp = IJ.openImage('https://imagej.net/images/t1-head.zip')
source_imp.show()

# Select middle slice (does not matter)
source_imp.setSlice(60)

# Instantiate the Dynamic_Reslice plugin
dr = fiji.stacks.Dynamic_Reslice(source_imp)

# Set up the plugin so that it will rotate the resulting image, and will 
# parse slices from bottom to top
dr.setRotate(True)
dr.setFlip(True)

# Get the destination ImagePlus
dest_imp = dr.getImagePlus()

# Now move the roi and update the image
for dx in range(170):
    
    IJ.showStatus('Moving the Roi by '+str(dx))
    
    # Draw a line ROI on the source imp
    roi = Line(xstart+dx, ystart, xstart+dx, ystart+170)
    source_imp.setRoi(roi)
    
    # Update the reslice. We have to call it manually in the script.
    dr.update();
    
    # Wait a bit so that we can see what is happening
    time.sleep(0.03)
    
IJ.showStatus('Done')
