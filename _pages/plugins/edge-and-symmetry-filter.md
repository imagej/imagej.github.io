## Edge and Symmetry filter

3D Canny-Deriche edge detection filter and symmetry filter.

## Author

Thomas Boudier

## Description

This plugin will compute the gradients of the image based on the {% include wikipedia title="Canny edge detector" %}. The symmetry filter will vote for the voxels inside the object based on the gradient vector direction.

**Alpha parameter** refers to the smoothing in canny edge detection, the smaller the value, the smoother the edges.

The **radius** parameter refer to the radius of the object whose symmetry is to be detected. Normalization and scaling refer to internal values of the algorithm, see Gertych *et al.* for references. The smoothed version is smoothed using ImageJ 3D Gaussian filter with a radius 2.

The **improved seed detection** refer to a modified implementation to better detect seeds inside objects rather than objects themselves.

The gradient vector is perpendicular to the edges, voxels along the direction of the gradient are highlighted and *vote* for the symmetry.
