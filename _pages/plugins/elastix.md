## Overview

Elastix is a Fiji plugin that wraps [elastix](http://elastix.isi.uu.nl/) into a graphical user interface. elastix is a collection of algorithms that are commonly used to solve image registration problems. Both 2D and 3D as well as multi-channel registrations are supported. Several rigid (translation, Euler, similarity, and affine) as well as locally deformable (BSpline) registrations are supported. For more information please visit the GitHub [README](https://github.com/embl-cba/fiji-plugin-elastixWrapper#fiji-plugins-for-running-elastix-and-transformix).

## Installation

Elastix is available from the ImageJ update site: http://sites.imagej.net/EMBL-CBA.

For details on how to install an update site click [here](/update-sites/following).

To use this plugin you also need to install elastix itself, as described [here](https://github.com/embl-cba/fiji-plugin-elastixWrapper/blob/master/README.md#install-elastix-binary).

To start Elastix in ImageJ, select {% include bc path="Plugins | Registration | Elastix | Elastix" %} from the main menu.
