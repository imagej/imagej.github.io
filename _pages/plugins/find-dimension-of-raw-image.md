Purpose
-------

This script serves two purposes:

-   to demonstrate that an AWT Listener can be written in Jython, and
-   to find the width of an image you know is uncompressed, but do not know the dimensions.

To use it, open the raw image with {% include bc content='File | Import | Raw...'%} choosing a width and height that should roughly be the correct one. Then start this script, which will open a dialog box with a slider, with which you can interactively test new widths -- the pixels in the image window will be updated accordingly.

The script is maintained by {% include person content='Schindelin' %}.
