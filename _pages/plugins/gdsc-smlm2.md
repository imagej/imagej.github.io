GDSC SMLM plugins provide various tools for single molecule localisation analysis.

-   Fit an image, or series of images, using a 2D Guassian Point Spread Function (PSF)
-   Save results to a table, a file, an image and/or to memory
-   Trace or cluster localisations through time to identify molecules
-   Correct drift in long time course images
-   Estimate fluorophore dark-time and blinking rate
-   Create localisation density images
-   Create custom PSFs from calibration images
-   Create simulated data using a Gaussian or custom PSF with configurable molecule populations and diffusion
-   Calibrate the gain and read noise of your microscope camera
-   Estimate noise in an image
-   Estimate resolution using Fourier Ring Correlation (FRC)
