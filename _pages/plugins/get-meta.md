## **Overview**

This plugin extracts the metadata from DM3 files and saves the information in a text file, which can be useful for importing that info into a database.

## **How it works**

It asks you to choose the directory in which the images are saved, and then it loops through the list of images extracting and saving the image info to text files of the same name.

## **Image Requirements**

It will only operate on the files with the .DM3 extension in the directory. So you can have other files in there that won't be operated on by the plugin.
