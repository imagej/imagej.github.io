{% include info-box name='Glasbey' software='Discontinuous color table' maintainer='Gabriel Landini' source='https://github.com/fiji/fiji/blob/master/luts/glasbey.lut and https://github.com/fiji/fiji/blob/master/luts/glasbey_inverted.lut' category='[Color\_processing](/plugin-index#color-processing)' %}![](/media/glasbey.png)The Glasbey lookup table (LUT) is a color table structured in a maximally discontinuous manner. That is, adjacent color bins are chosen to be as distinct from one another as possible.

Like other LUTs, it is available from the {% include bc path='Image | Lookup Tables'%} menu.

The LUT called "glasbey" uses white at the first index, whereas "glasbey inverted" starts with black.

## Labelings

The Glasbey LUT has numerous uses. It is ideal when coloring a "labeling" of integer-coded regions, since each region will then appear obviously distinct:

## JPEG artifacts

Glasbey can also be used to illustrate otherwise-subtle phenomena such as JPEG compression artifacts. Here is a comparison of the Boats sample image before and after being resaved as a JPEG:

## Publication

The Glasbey LUT is based on the publication:
