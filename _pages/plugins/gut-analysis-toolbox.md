title: Gut Analysis Toolbox
description: Gut Analysis Toolbox or GAT allows the semi-automated analysis of the cells within the enteric nervous system of the gastrointestinal tract in **2D**. GAT enables quantification of enteric neurons and their subtypes in gut wholemounts. It runs in Fiji, a popular image analysis software in microscopy and uses custom deep learning models to segment cells of interest.

**Gut Analysis Toolbox** enables semi-automated analysis of the neuronal and glial distribution within the gut wall (enteric nervous system). It uses a combination of `FIJI macros`, [StarDist](https://github.com/stardist/stardist), [CLIJ](https://clij.github.io/) 
and [deepImageJ](https://deepimagej.github.io/deepimagej/) for segmentation and analysis.

Click [here to access the WIKI](https://github.com/pr4deepr/GutAnalysisToolbox/wiki) detailed instructions on how to use GAT.A detailed how to use instructions with wiki is available here: 

You can also watch tutorials for GAT on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmBt1Dumq60p4mIFT4j7TP_PVRjbO55Oi).

What you can do with GAT:
* Semi-automated analysis of number of enteric neurons: Uses pan-neuronal marker Hu or anything with similar 
 labelling
* Normalise counts to the number of ganglia.
* Count number of neuronal subtypes, such as ChAT, nNOS etc..
* Spatial analysis using number of neighboring cells.
* Calcium imaging analysis: Alignment of images and extraction of normalised traces
