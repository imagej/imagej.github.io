This plugin is an HDF5 reader/writer plugin for [ImageJ](/about) and [Fiji](/fiji). It is a continuation of the [original code](http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/opensource/imagej_plugins/hdf5.html) by Matthias Schlachter, Olaf Ronneberger and Kun Liu.

HDF5 is a data format for storing extremely large and complex data collections. For more information, see the [official website](http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/). The plugin uses the [jhdf5 library from ETH SIS](https://wiki-bsse.ethz.ch/display/JHDF5) for reading and writing HDF5 files.

For further details, see the {% include github org='fiji' repo='HDF5\_Vibez' label='fiji/HDF5\_Vibez' %} repository on GitHub.
