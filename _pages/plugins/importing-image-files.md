The File / Import submenu
-------------------------

Most of the commands listed, particularly Fiji extensions, are also available (via ImageJ's [HandleExtraFileTypes](https://imagej.net/plugins/file-handler.html) feature) simply by using the File / Open... menu item.

Built-in formats
----------------

Fiji primarily uses TIFF as the image file format. The menu command {% include bc content='File | Save'%} will save in TIFF format. The menu command {% include bc content='File | Open'%} will open TIFF files and import a number of other common file formats (e.g. JPEG, GIF, BMP, PGM, PNG) as well as those detailed below. Files can be also dragged and dropped to the toolbar to open them.

Bio-Formats
-----------

Many more file formats can be imported via Fiji plugins. One plugin is called [Bio-Formats](/formats/bio-formats). This will import and export a wide number of file formats along with their important metadata. They can be accessed directly via the menu command {% include bc content='File | Import | Bio-Formats'%} or indirectly via the {% include bc content='File | Open'%} menu command which will use the Bio-Formats plugin if needed. See the [list of supported file formats](http://openmicroscopy.org/site/support/bio-formats5/supported-formats.html) on the Bio-Formats website for the complete list (135 as of this writing).

If Bio-Formats is used, you will be prompted with a big dialog and your preferences remembered.

Drag and dropping an image file to the Fiji toolbar will effectively open the file the same as the {% include bc content='File | Open'%} command.

Some image file formats are more akin to databases rather than images (e.g. Leica LIF files). In these cases a second dialog will list the images in the 'database' prompting you to select which to open.

There are several different Bio-Formats commands for importing data into Fiji:

-   **Bio-Formats Remote Importer.** For this selection, the image doesn’t have to be saved onto your computer or a disk. But it is a limited feature; it is more robust to download the file and then use the regular Bio-Formats instead.
-   **Bio-Formats Windowless Importer.** With this option, Fiji uses the settings that were previously used for Bio-Formats, so it skips all dialog boxes at the beginning.
-   **Bio-Formats Importer.** Select this command if you need to change the settings for importing an image.

Zeiss LSM panel
---------------

The LSM panel plugin duplicates the Zeiss LSM file import function of the LOCI Bio-Format Importer, but will also extensively catalogue the LSM metadata. The *[LSM Toolbox](/formats/lsm)* is activated by the menu command {% include bc content='File | Import | LSM.'%} Once you select LSM the panel will appear.

Images are opened as 8-bit color images with the “no-palette” pseudo color from the LSM acquisition software. Each channel is imported as a separate image/stack. Lambda stacks are therefore imported as multiple images, not a single stack. They can be converted to a stack with the menu command: {% include bc content='Image | Stacks | Images to stack.'%}

Once opened, the file information can be accessed and the information can be irreversibly stamped into the images or exported.

Multiple files from a folder
----------------------------

Each time point of an experiment acquired with software such as Perkin Elmer’s UltraVIEW or Scion Image’s time lapse macro is saved by the acquisition software as a single TIF. The experimental sequence can be imported to Fiji via the menu command {% include bc content='File | Import | Image Sequence.'%}

Locate the directory, click on the first image in the sequence and OK all dialogs. (You may get a couple of error messages while Fiji tries to open any non-image files in the experimental directory.) The stack will “interleave” the multiple channels you recorded, and can be de-interleaved via {% include bc content='Plugins | Stacks - Shuffling | Deinterleave'%}

Selected images that are not the same size can be imported as individual images windows using *File/Import* and select each individual image you want imported into Fiji. Then you can put those images into a stack by {% include bc content='Image | Stacks | Images to stack'%} Unlike the {% include bc content='File | Import | Image Sequence'%} function, the images don’t need to be the same dimensions. If memory is limited, stacks can be opened as Virtual-Stacks with most of the stack remaining on the disk until it is required.

Multi-RAW sequence from a folder
--------------------------------

To form an image, Fiji needs to know the image dimensions, bit-depth, slice number per file and any extraneous information in the file format (offset and header size). All you really need to tell it is the image dimension in x and y. These values should be obtainable from the software in which the images were acquired. Armed with this information follow these steps:

1.  File/Import/Raw…
2.  Select experimental directory.
3.  Typical values for the dialog box are:
    -   Image type = 16-bit unsigned (or 8 bit typically)
    -   Width and height as determined earlier
    -   Offset = 0, number of image = 1, gap = 0, ‘white’ is zero = off
    -   ‘Little-endian byte order’ = on, ‘open all files in folder’ = on to open all files in folder.

Non-images will also be opened and may appear as blank images and need deleting: {% include bc content='Image | Stacks | Delete slice'%}. The stack will "interleave” the multiple channels you recorded, and can be de-interleaved via {% include bc content='Plugins | Stacks - Shuffling | DeInterleave'%}.

AVI and MOV files
-----------------

There are two plugins which can open uncompressed AVIs and some types of MOV file. AVIs can be opened via {% include bc content='File | Import | AVI'%}

Other Import functions
----------------------

Animated GIF- This plugin opens animated GIF files as an RGB stack. Also opens single GIF images.

Fiji Extensions
---------------

-   **Amira...**: Open as a stack both Amira (.am) label and image stack files.
-   **Biorad...**: Open a Biorad (.pic) confocal stack.
-   **Psychomorph .tem Reader**
-   **Show Amira Surface**: Open in a 3D Window Amira .surf surface files (3D meshes).
