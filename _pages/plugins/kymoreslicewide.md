This plugin builds [kymographs](/tutorials/generate-and-exploit-kymographs) using straight line, polyline or freehand selection of variable thickness (and using either average or maximum intensity across the line). So it is extended implementation of ImageJ's *Reslice* function. Here are some thought on "[Why another kymograph plugin?](http://katpyxa.info/feedbacks/?p=26)".

## Using plugin

Open the stack/movie to be analyzed in ImageJ. Draw a line along the area where you want to make a kymograph.  
You can use ImageJ's *native* **embedded** characteristics of the line/curve, like:

### Line type

Plugin automatically picks up your choice of line selection from ImageJ and corrects for its length.  
Just use the one you need.

### Line width

Define the width of line using double click on the line selection tool in ImageJ

### Parameters

After that the window showing kymograph parameters will pop-up:

Where following options are available (in order):

-   whether to take average or maximum intensity transverse to line;
-   (unchecked) time as y-axis, distance as x-axis, (checked) time as x-axis, distance as y-axis;
-   (checked) curve will be added and displayed in the overlay of original movie/stack to mark already analyzed region;
-   ignore original image/stack calibration, i.e. don't add its calibration to the final kymograph image (width, height, vortex size and frame rate)

## Other kymograph plugins

As alternative, there is very well documented [Multi Kymograph](/plugins/multi-kymograph) plugin and its updated version [Kymograph tool](http://biop.epfl.ch/TOOL_KYMOGRAPH.html).

## Version history

version 0.5 (2017/04/01): hyperstacks reslice fixed (now time, not Z) and image calibration handling is improved (with option to ignore it).

version 0.4 (2015/10/21): now it works with hyperstacks and RGB images.
