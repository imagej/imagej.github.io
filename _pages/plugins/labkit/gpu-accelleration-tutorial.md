# Labkit - How To Enable And Use GPU Acceleration

Labkit can use NVIDIA graphics cards to speed up calculation and segment images faster. The speed difference is significant but will vary from machine to machine. In order to perform GPU-accelerated segmentation, follow these steps:

1. Install [CLIJ2 in Fiji](https://clij.github.io/clij2-docs/installationInFiji)
2. In Labkit, after selecting a classifier, open the "Classifier Settings" and select "Use GPU acceleration".
