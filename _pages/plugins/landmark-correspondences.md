The landmarks are read from point selections over two images. The transformation is estimated by a least squares or Moving Least Squares fit for the available models.

The non-linear non-invertible transformations as estimated using the Moving Least Squares method are rendered through a mesh of triangles whose resolution is a parameter of the plugin, see [Interactive Moving Least Squares](/plugins/interactive-moving-least-squares) for an intuitive explanation.
