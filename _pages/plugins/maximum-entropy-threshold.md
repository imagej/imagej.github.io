## Purpose

This plugin threshold an image using the Maximum Entropy algorithm, which is similar to [Otsu Thresholding](Otsu_Thresholding) technique. Here, rather than maximizing the inter-class variance (equivalently, minimizing the within-class variance), the inter-class *entropy* is maximized.

## Documentation

The plugin requires a 8-bit image to process. It outputs directly the thresholded image, replacing the original one.

It processes stacks correctly, by operating on the whole stack histogram to determine the threshold. A new, thresholded stack replace the original one.
