Purpose
-------

This plugin allows the user to apply four different automatic thresholding algorithms. The four algorithms are ImageJ's built in IsoData algorithm, [Maximum Entropy Threshold](/plugins/maximum-entropy-threshold), [Otsu Thresholding](Otsu_Thresholding), and [Mixture Modeling](/plugins/mixture-modeling-thresholding). More information about thresholding and the algorithms employed here can be found at the [Image Thresholding Tutorial](http://www.ph.tn.tudelft.nl/Courses/FIP/noframes/fip-Segmenta.html).

Usage
-----

This plugin is quite convenient, for it groups different techniques in one. It has nevertheless a major drawback when used on stacks. When operating on a stack, it computes the threshold on the *single* image currently displayed, and will apply this threshold value to *all* of the other images, which might not be relevant.
