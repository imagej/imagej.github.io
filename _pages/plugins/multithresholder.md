## Purpose

This plugin allows the user to apply four different automatic thresholding
algorithms. The four algorithms are ImageJ's built in IsoData algorithm,
[Maximum Entropy Threshold](/plugins/maximum-entropy-threshold),
[Otsu Thresholding](Otsu_Thresholding), and
[Mixture Modeling](/plugins/mixture-modeling-thresholding). More information
about thresholding and the algorithms employed here can be found at the
[Image Thresholding Tutorial](http://www.ph.tn.tudelft.nl/Courses/FIP/noframes/fip-Segmenta.html).

## Usage

This plugin is quite convenient, for it groups different techniques in one. It
has nevertheless a major drawback when used on stacks. When operating on a
stack, it computes the threshold on the *single* image currently displayed, and
will apply this threshold value to *all* of the other images, which might not
be relevant.
