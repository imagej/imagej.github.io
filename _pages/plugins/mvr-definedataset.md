## Select Type of Dataset

![](/media/plugins/mvr-define1.png)

There are three types of datasets:

-   Image Stacks (LOCI Bioformats)
    -   to open non TIFF images
-   Image Stacks (ImageJ Opener)
    -   use this to open TIFF and zipped TIFFS
-   Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1 Dataset
    -   experimental way of opening Zeiss data

## Define Dataset 1/3

This dialog specifies of what your dataset consists of:

-   timepoints
-   channels
-   illumination directions
-   angles

## Define Dataset 2/3

This dialog asks you several facts:

-   image directory
-   image file pattern
    -   there are 3 different variables. They are used to identify the images. All of them can have leading zeros, e.g. {aaa} for a angle of 045 degrees or {tttt} for 0014 as a time point
        -   {t} - time points
        -   {c} - channel
        -   {a} - angles
-   time points, channels and angles can be given as a comma seperated list or in a more elegant way, {start}-{end}:{interval}
-   calibration can be either read from file or entered by hand
-   data container, smaller image stacks can use **ArrayImg**, bigger one should use **CellImg**

In case you selected the option, a list of found files will be presented ![](/media/plugins/mvr-define4.png)

## Define Dataset 3/3

Finally the plugin shows you the calibration it read from the files or asks for it. ![](/media/plugins/mvr-define5.png)
