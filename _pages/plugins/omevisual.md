## Presentation

`OMEVisual` is a Fiji plugin to easily visualize OME metadata.

Usage:

-   Open your image in Fiji.
-   Start the plugin with {% include bc path="Plugins | Utilities | Visualize OME Metadata" %}.
-   A window should open with the metadata in it.

Please note that :

-   This goal of this plugin is **not to implement** all the OME features.
-   This plugin makes several strong assumptions about the OME model in order to simplify the interface :
    -   Each image contains only one `Pixels` element.
    -   Each `TiffData` contains only one `Plane`.
    -   `Plane` and `TiffData` informations are displayed at the same location without distinction.
-   Any ideas to improve the visualization and/or add OME features is very welcome :
    -   The best way is to submit a PR.
    -   You can also open an issue and post an OME-TIFF file which contains additional OME features you would like to see added to the plugin.
