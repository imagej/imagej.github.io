*Pendent drop profile integration and fitting*

## Brief description

This plug-in allows for interactive or automated adjustment of a profile to an image of a pendent drop. The plugin reports the capillary length providing the best fit, as well as surface tension, volume and surface associated with this profile.

## Description

The pendent drop method is commonly used to measure surface tensions of liquids. It consists in analysing the shape of a drop hanging typically from a capillary tube and about to detach (sometimes the inverse situation of a bubble forming at the bottom of a liquid is preferred, or that of a sessile drop or bubble). The shape is very sensitive to the unknown interfacial tension. The (axisymmetric) drop profile is described by only one non-dimensional parameter (tip radius over capillary length), although in practice five dimensional parameters can be adjusted within this plug-in: tip position and curvature, tilt of symetry axis and capillary length. The surface tension is calculated from the latter if the density difference is given.

## Installation

The latest stable version is uploaded to the Fiji update site http://sites.imagej.net/Daerr/

Follow the procedure described on the Fiji wiki at [How to follow a 3rd party update site](/update-sites/following) to have Fiji download and install the plugin (Fiji will keep track of updates).
