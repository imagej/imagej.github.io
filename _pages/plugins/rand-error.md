The {% include wikipedia title='Rand index' text='Rand index'%} is a well-known measure of the similarity between two data clusterings[1]. Recently, it has been proposed as a **measure of segmentation performance**, since a segmentation can be regarded as a clustering of pixels[2]. More formally, define a segmentation as an integer-valued labeling of an image. Each object in a segmentation consists of a set of pixels sharing a common label.

The {% include wikipedia title='Rand index' text='Rand index'%} is defined as a measure of agreement:

Given two segmentations $$S_1$$ and $$S_2$$ of an image $$I$$ with $$n$$ pixels, we define:

-   $$a$$, the number of pairs of pixels in $$I$$ that are in the same object in $$S_1$$ and in the same object in $$S_2$$ (i.e., they have the same label)

<!-- -->

-   $$b$$, the number of pairs of pixels in $$I$$ that are in different objects in $$S_1$$ and in different objects in $$S_2$$ (i.e., they have different labels)

The Rand index, $$RI$$, is: $$ RI = \frac{a+b}{n \choose 2 }$$

Here we instead define the closely related [Rand error](/plugins/rand-error), which is a measure of disagreement. The [Rand error](/plugins/rand-error) (RE) is the **frequency with which the two segmentations disagree over whether a pair of pixels belongs to same or different objects**:

$$ RE = 1 - RI$$

Implementation in Fiji
----------------------

The [Rand error](/plugins/rand-error) metric is implemented in the [Trainable Weka Segmentation](/plugins/tws) library. Here is an example of how to use it in a [Beanshell script](Beanshell_Scripting):

    import trainableSegmentation.metrics.RandError;
    import ij.IJ;

    // original labels
    originalLabels = IJ.openImage("/path/original-labels.tif");

    // proposed (new) labels
    proposedLabels = IJ.openImage("/path/proposed-labels.tif");

    // threshold to binarize labels
    threshold = 0.5;

    metric = new RandError( originalLabels, proposedLabels );
    randError = metric.getMetricValue( threshold );

    IJ.log("Rand error between source image " + originalLabels.getTitle() + " and target image "
    + proposedLabels.getTitle() + " = " + randError);
