{% include component-stats content='sc.fiji:Reconstruct\_Reader' %}The Reconstruct Reader plugin is a utility to transform [Reconstruct](http://synapses.clm.utexas.edu/tools/reconstruct/reconstruct.stm) projects directly into [TrakEM2](/plugins/trakem2) projects.

Usage
-----

Reconstruct projects consist of a folder containing a series file, a set of section files, and a set of image files. A series file will have a *.ser* extension, while a section file will have a numeric extension, like Project.1, Project.2, ... , Project.100, and so forth.

To translate a Reconstruct project into a TrakEM2 project, you may either open it through Fiji's {% include bc content='File | Open...'%} dialog, or through the {% include bc content='File | Import | Reconstruct Project...'%} dialog. Either one will prompt you to open a series file.

The log output will show That the Reconstruct Translator has been created, and that translation has begun. Translation often takes only a handful of seconds, but generating mipmaps will often take quite some time.

Function
--------

The Reconstruct Reader plugin functions by translating a Reconstruct project folder directly into a single TrakEM2 project *.xml* file, then opening that file in TrakEM2.

No changes are ever saved to the Reconstruct project. The new *.xml* file associated with the project should be opened for any successive TrakEM2 sessions.

Known Bugs and Issues
---------------------

-   After translation, the user is informed that TrakEM2 has detected a crash. This is because the translation process does not currently generate certain non-critical files that TrakEM2 expects to exist. This does not indicate an actual problem.
