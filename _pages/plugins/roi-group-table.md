The Roi group is a convenient built-in functionalitiy of ImageJ/Fiji to annotate ROIs of different categories.  
The group attribute of ROIs is a simple number (integer) associated to a predefined color, such that ROIs from the same group are displayed with the same color.  
In addition to the color, one can also associate category names to the group values, via the menu `Edit > Options > Roi Defaults`.   
However the default interface is not very convenient when one should define multiple groups.  
The RoiGroupTable plugin here proposes an alternative interface in the form of an interactive table to define the category names associated to the group numbers. 


# Installation

Activate the **RoiGroupTable** update site.  
Restart Fiji. The plugin will be listed under the menu *Edit > Options* (as well as at the bottom of the Plugins menu).
