## Purpose

The sciview plugin provides 3D visualization and virtual reality capabilities for images and meshes using the [scenery](https://github.com/scenerygraphics/scenery) library. It integrates [ImageJ2](/software/imagej2) functionality, including [ImageJ Ops](/libs/imagej-ops) and [ImageJ Mesh](https://github.com/imagej/imagej-mesh), to provide the ability to interact with image and mesh data in 3D and interface with the popular [Fiji](/software/fiji) software ecosystem.

More information is available on the [official sciview documentation](https://docs.scenery.graphics/sciview).
