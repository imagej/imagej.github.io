Running the plugin "Plugins - Segmentation - Segment blob in 3D Viewer" will add capabilities to all existing 3D Viewer windows. A new 3D Viewer window opens if none are already open.

{% include thumbnail src='/media/Blob-segmentation.jpg' title='Segment blob in 3D Viewer: example of resulting mesh (in green) overlaid on the original image volume (the sample file "bat cochlea volume").'%}

Segmenting a blob
=================

Step 1: add an image volume from "File - Add content".

Step 2: select the **magic wand** tool.

Step 3: click on a bright place of an image volume.

A results window will open with surface and volume measurements, and the 3d coordinates of the blob.

Canceling an ongoing segmentation
=================================

Push the {% include key content='Esc' %} key. You may have to do so while having the Fiji toolbar window activated.

Adjusting parameters of the segmentation
========================================

Internally, the [Level Sets](/plugins/level-sets) plugin is used. To adjust its many parameters, do a {% include key content='Shift' %}+{% include key content='click' %} with the magic wand. The dialog will open; it's the same dialog as shown in the [Level Sets](/plugins/level-sets) documentation page.
