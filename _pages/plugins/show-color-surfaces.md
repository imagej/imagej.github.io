This plugin allows you to add surfaces generated from *label field stacks* to a new or existing 3D viewer.

A *label field* is an 8-bit image stack where the numbers attached to each pixels refer to a specific class rather than an intensity. Usually, label fields are visualized using a lookup table so that different classes are shown as different colors.

The *Show Color Surfaces* command calculates surfaces embedded into the [3D Viewer](/plugins/3d-viewer) from label fields:
