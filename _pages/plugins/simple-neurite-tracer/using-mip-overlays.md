If you are tracing bright neurons with a structure that appears clear when viewed in a Maximum Intensity Projection of the stack, you can now use a couple of new features of Simple Neurite Tracer to speed up your tracing. These are:

-   The menu option "Show MIP overlays at 20% opacity". This overlays the Maximum Intensity Projection over the slice views of your data, regardless of which your current slice is.
-   The key shortcut 'm', while your mouse is over a point in the image, is the same as a left mouse click at the point of maximum intensity under that point throughout the whole stack.

These features are demonstrated in the following screencast. (I'm afraid that the 3D viewer hasn't been captured properly in this screencast, but I hope it's still pretty clear what's going on.)
