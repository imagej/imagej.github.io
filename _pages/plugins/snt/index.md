SNT[^1] is ImageJ's framework for tracing, visualization, quantitative analyses and modeling of neuronal morphology. For tracing, SNT supports modern multidimensional microscopy data, semi-automated and automated routines, and options for editing traces. For data analysis, SNT features advanced visualization tools, access to all major morphology databases, and support for whole-brain circuitry data.

## Overview

SNT is a toolbox for tracing and analyzing neuronal morphologies imaged using light microscopy. It aims to be as complete as possible, while remaining efficient to use. It can be used as a desktop application, or a [scripting library](/plugins/snt/scripting). It supersedes the original [Simple Neurite Tracer](/plugins/snt/faq#what-is-the-difference-between-snt-and-simple-neurite-tracer) software, and aggregates other tools previously scattered across the Fiji ecosystem of plugins, including [Sholl](./sholl)[^2] and [Strahler](./strahler) plugins.

The [source repository](https://github.com/morphonets/SNT) contains more details about the project, including a list of [features](https://github.com/morphonets/SNT#features), and [implementation details](https://github.com/morphonets/SNT/blob/-/NOTES.md#notes). Below is a gallery showcasing SNT's functionality:

## Installation

SNT is currently distributed through [Fiji](/software/fiji)'s [Neuroanatomy update site](/update-sites/neuroanatomy). The first time you start SNT from Fiji's menu structure ({% include bc path='Plugins|Neuroanatomy|SNT'%}), you should be prompted for automatic subscription and download of required dependencies. If not:

1. Run the Fiji [Updater](/plugins/updater) ({% include bc path='Help|Update...'%}, the penultimate entry in the {% include bc path='Help|'%} menu)
2. Click *Manage update sites*
3. Search for *Neuroanatomy* (or *SNT*) and activate the *Neuroanatomy* checkbox
4. Click *Apply changes* and restart Fiji

**Optional**: For [sciview](/plugins/sciview) and [Cx3D](/plugins/snt/modeling) functionality, you need to install [sciview](/plugins/sciview). See the [official sciview documentation](https://docs.scenery.graphics/sciview) for details.
