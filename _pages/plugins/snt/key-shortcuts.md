Most SNT features are triggered by keyboard shortcuts. Shortcuts are typically single keystrokes and most do not require other modifier keys to be pressed. Most are highlighted in the user interface. E.g., to toggle the *Trace/Fill on Secondary <u>L</u>ayer* checkbox, one only needs to press its highlighted letter, i.e., {% include key key='L' %}.

_Typically_, when {% include key keys='ctlcmd' %} is pressed, hotkeys are not intercepted by SNT. E.g., During a tracing session pressing {% include key key='N' %} triggers <u>N</u>o* in the interactive prompt while {% include key keys='ctlcmd|N' %} will trigger IJ's built-in command {% include bc path='File|New|image...'%}.

The [Command Palette](manual#command-palette) ({% include key keys='ctlcmd|Shift|P' %}) is the fastest way to access actions and discover their respective shortcuts!

### Interactive Prompt

| {% include key key='C' %}  | <u>C</u>ancels a path. Note that you can finish a path by pressing {% include key key='N' %} {% include key key='N' %} twice |
| {% include key key='F' %}  | <u>F</u>inishes a path. Note that you can finish a path by pressing {% include key key='Y' %} {% include key key='Y' %} twice |
| {% include key key='N' %}  | Discards the current temporary path. *Mnemonic: <u>N</u>o*  |
| {% include key key='Y' %}  | Confirms the current temporary path. *Mnemonic: <u>Y</u>es* |
| {% include key key='Esc' %}| Aborts current operation / Exits current mode |


### Navigation and Zoom

| {% include key key='Shift' %}    | Synchronizes XY, ZY, and XZ views while moving the cursor when not using cursor snapping |
| {% include key key='+' %} / {% include key key='-' %}      | Zooms in/out (Simultaneously on all views) (IJ default) |
| {% include key key='4' %}        | Displays tracing view(s) at original scale (IJ default) |
| {% include key key='5' %}        | Displays tracing view(s) at 100% (IJ default) |
| {% include key key='Spacebar' %} | Activates the Pan (Hand) tool (IJ default) |
| {% include key key='>' %} / {% include key key='<' %} | Previous/Next Z-slice, or Previous/Next channel, depending on the *Reverse CZT oder of "&gt;" and "&lt;"* choice set in IJ's {% include bc path='Edit|Options|Misc...'%} prompt (IJ default) |
| {% include key key='enter' %}    | Shuttles the window focus between the tracing image and the SNT window |
| {% include key key='Ctrl|Tab' %} {% include key key='Ctrl|Shift|Tab' %} | Activates the next/previous tab in the main SNT window |


### Path Handling

| {% include key key='1' %} | Toggles the first visibility filter: Whether all traced paths should be displayed or just selected ones |
| {% include key key='2' %} | Toggles the second visibility filter: Whether all nodes should be displayed across the Z-stack or just those in nearby Z-slices |
| {% include key key='3' %} | Toggles the third visibility filter: Whether paths from all channels/frames should be displayed or just those in the active channel/frame |
| {% include key key='G' %} | Selects the nearest path to the mouse cursor. Holding {% include key keys='Shift|G' %} adds the path nearest to the mouse cursor to the current list of selected paths. *Mnemonic: <u>G</u>roup paths around cursor.* Note that Paths can only be edited one at a time, and thus {% include key keys='Shift|G' %} is disabled in *Edit Mode* |
| {% include key key='H' %} | Temporarily <u>H</u>ides alls paths/annotations while being pressed |


### Tracing

These shortcuts are available when running SNT in *Tracing Mode*:

| {% include key keys='Ctrl|S' %} / {% include key keys='Command|S' %}           | <u>S</u>ave tracings |
| {% include key key='Ctrl|Shift|S' %} / {% include key keys='Command|Shift|S' %} | <u>S</u>ave <u>S</u>napshot Backup |
| {% include key key='L' %}                     | Toggles Tracing/Filling on Secondary <u>L</u>ayer (filtered image) |
| {% include key key='V' %}                     | Finds the brightest <u>V</u>oxel above and below the current x,y position and automatically clicks on it. If multiple maxima exist, their average positioning is used. Note that this feature assumes that neurites are brighter than the background |
| {% include key key='S' %}                     | Toggles cursor <u>S</u>napping: If enabled, the plugin will automatically move the cursor to the brightest voxel within the specified x,y,z snapping window<sup>1</sup>. When set correctly, this facilitates accurate [positioning of path points](/plugins/snt/walkthroughs#accurate-point-placement) |
| {% include key keys='Alt|Shift|Left Click' %} | Selects a point along the active path to be used as forking point (See [step-by-step instructions](/plugins/snt/walkthroughs#branching-start-a-path-on-an-existing-path) for more details on joining and branching). This shortcut can be [simplified](/plugins/snt/manual#temporary-paths) |
| {% include key keys='Shift|B' %}              | <u>B</u>ookmarks cursor location |
| {% include key keys='Shift|E' %}              | Activates *Edit Mode* (<u>E</u>diting of selected Path) |
| {% include key keys='Shift|P' %}              | <u>P</u>auses tracing operations |


### Path Editing

These shortcuts become available in *Edit Mode*, activated through the contextual menu (displayed with {% include key keys='Right Click' %} on a tracing canvas), or by pressing {% include key keys='Shift|E' %}:

### Legacy 3D Viewer

The most important shortcuts for the [Legacy 3D viewer](/plugins/snt/walkthroughs#tracing-in-the-legacy-3d-viewer) are:

| {% include key key='H' %} | Selects the <u>H</u>and (pan) tool |
| {% include key key='W' %} | Selects the <u>W</u>and (tracing) tool |
| {% include key keys='Middle Drag' %} | Rotation |
| {% include key keys='Shift|Middle Drag' %} | Pan (translation) |
| {% include key keys='Mouse Wheel' %} | Zoom |
| {% include key keys='Shift|Left Drag' %} | When Hand tool is active: Pan (translation) |
| {% include key keys='Left Drag' %} | When Hand tool is active: Rotation |

In addition, _most_ shortcuts that are not specific to tracing canvases (XY, ZY and XZ views) can be used in the 3D Viewer. When a key stroke is not recognized by the 3D Viewer, a mesage is displayed in the [status bar](/plugins/snt/manual#status-bar) of the main dialog.


### Other

There are other key and mouse combinations used in e.g., [Sholl Analysis (by Focal Point)](/plugins/snt/analysis#sholl-analysis), and [Branching and Joining Paths](/plugins/snt/walkthroughs#branching-start-a-path-on-an-existing-path), that are listed in the contextual menu, displayed when right-clicking a tracing canvas.
