Synthetic neuron generated using the {% include bc content='Demo|Cx3D|Random Branching'%} command ([source code](https://github.com/morphonets/cx3d/blob/master/src/main/java/sc/iview/cx3d/commands/RandomBranchingDemo.java)), accessible from SciView's main menu.

{% include thumbnail src='/media/Cx3d-sciview.png' title=title %} Modeling in SNT is performed through [Cortex3D (Cx3D)](https://github.com/morphonets/cx3d) and [SciView](/plugins/sciview). Cx3D was developed in 2009[1] as a computational modeling tool for simulating neurodevelopmental processes and is well known for generative models of cortical circuits.

The [Morphonets](http://morphonets.org) distribution of Cx3D was modified by {% include person content='Kharrington' %} to be compatible with the ImageJ and Fiji ecosystem. This includes using [SciView](/plugins/sciview) for 3D visualization, and support for image-based modeling.

Currently, an [IDE](/develop/ides) is the most effective way to implement custom models, using the [minimal-cx3d-example-project](https://github.com/morphonets/minimal-cx3d-example-project) as a template. For more information refer to the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/morphonets/cx3d).
