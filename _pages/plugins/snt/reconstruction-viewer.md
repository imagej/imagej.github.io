Starting the Viewer
===================

The Reconstruction Viewer may be used as either a standalone program or from within SNT. To open Reconstruction Viewer as a standalone program, go to {% include bc path='Plugins|NeuroAnatomy|Reconstruction Viewer'%}. To open the program from within SNT, use the "Open Reconstruction Viewer" option in the 3D tab of the SNT dialog. If there are any tracings currently loaded in SNT, they will be displayed in Reconstruction Viewer after opening. Note that, for performance reasons, some Path Manager changes may need to be synchronized manually from RV controls.

Scene Interaction
=================

The display canvas supports multiple modes of interaction, including controlled rotations, panning, zoom, scaling, animation, and alternation between "dark" and "light" modes. The full list of keyboard shortcuts is found by navigating to {% include bc path='Scene Controls|Scene Shortcuts...'%} from RV Controls, or by pressing {% include key content='H' %} (notification) or {% include key content='F1' %} (separate window) in the Viewer scene. <img src="/media/Reconstruction-viewer-shortcuts.png" title="fig:" width="400" /> {% include clear%}


RV Controls
===========

Scene Controls
--------------

<img src="/media/Reconstruction-viewer-scene-controls.png" title="fig:" width="400" /> This menu provides control over the rendered scene.

-   {% include bc path='Fit to Visible Objects'%} {% include key content='F' %} Computes a bounding box containing all objects of the scene and adjusts the zoom level to ensure all objects are within the camera view.
-   {% include bc path='Stretch-to-Fill'%} Stretches the projection on the whole viewport.

<div align="left">

-   <img src="/media/Reconstruction-viewer-not-stretched.png" title="fig:Stretch-to-Fill - disabled" width="200" alt="Stretch-to-Fill - disabled" />
-   <img src="/media/Reconstruction-viewer-stretched.png" title="fig:Stretch-to-Fill - enabled" width="200" alt="Stretch-to-Fill - enabled" />

</div>

-   {% include bc path='Impose Isotropic Scale|  '%} Squares the aspect ratio of the selected dimensions, leaving the others unchanged.

<div align="left">

-   <img src="/media/Reconstruction-viewer-aspect-ratio-none.png" title="fig:Impose Isotropic Scale - None" width="200" alt="Impose Isotropic Scale - None" />

-   {% include bc path='Reload Scene'%} {% include key content='CTRL' %} + {% include key content='R' %} Resets the zoom level to the default, fitting and centering all scene objects into the camera view. The current rotation setting remains unchanged. Note if some drawables in the 3D scene are not being rendered properly when this option is selected, it will prompt to rebuild the scene completely.
-   {% include bc path='Rebuild Scene...'%} {% include key content='CTRL' %} + {% include key content='SHIFT' %} + {% include key content='R' %} Clears all objects from the scene then rebuilds them from scratch.
-   {% include bc path='Wipe Scene...'%} Removes all objects from the scene. Note this action cannot be undone.
-   {% include bc path='Sync Path Manager Changes'%} If the 3D scene contains any trees that are currently stored in the Path Manager, re-render these trees to reflect any change in the path structure given by the Path Manager.

Manage and Customize Neuronal Arbors
