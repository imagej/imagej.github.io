# SNT Scripts

A key feature of SNT is its extensibility via scripts.This section provides an overview to the ever-growing list of SNT scripts. These can be accessed through the {% include bc path='Plugins|NeuroAnatomy|Neuroanatomy Shortcut Window' %}, the *Scripts* menu in the main dialog, or the {% include bc path='Templates|Neuroanatomy'%} menu of Fiji's Script Editor. Typically, holding {% include key key='Shift' %} while selecting a script from a menu outside the [Script Editor](/scripting/script-editor) will open it.

SNT Scripts are intentionally written in multiple languages, but the majority is written in [Groovy](/scripting/groovy/)and [Python](/scripting/python) (Jython), for no other reason that those seem to be the most commonly used language by its developers

## Adding Scripts to SNT

There are a couple of ways to have your own scripts appear in SNT's *Scripts* menu:

Any script saved into Fiji's "scripts" sub-directory containing *SNT* in the filename (e.g., `C:\Users\user\Desktop\Fiji.app\scripts\My_SNT_Script.py` or `/home/user/Fiji.app/scripts/My_SNT_Script.py`) will be listed in {% include bc path='Scripts'%} menu:

1. Go to {% include bc path='Scripts|New...'%} from the SNT dialog. This will open an instance of Fiji's Script Editor with pre-loaded boilerplate code in the scripting language of your choice.

2. Save the script in `Fiji.app/scripts/` including 'SNT' anywhere in its file name

3. Run {% include bc path='Scripts|Reload...'%}, and your new script should appear in the full list of scripts found at {% include bc path='Scripts|Full List...'%}.

Did you write a useful script? Please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/morphonets/SNT/pulls) on GitHub so that it can be distributed with Fiji!

## Script Interpreter

Some of SNT's functionality is accessible in the [Script Interpreter](/scripting/interpreter). Here is an example:

<div align="center">
  <img src="/media/plugins/snt/snt-scriptinterpreter.png" title="SNT-ScriptInterpreter.png" width="650px" />
</div>

## Script Templates

<img align="right" src="/media/plugins/snt/snt-scripts-menu-full-list.png" title="SNT Scripts Menu" width="400" />
These typically demonstrate various aspects of analysis, tracing, image processing and batch processing routines.

### Analysis

- **Analysis\_Demo\_(Interactive).py** Exemplifies how to programmatically interact with a running instance of SNT to analyze traced data. Because of all the GUI updates, this approach is *significantly slower* than analyzing reconstructions directly (see Analysis\_Demo.py for comparison)

- **Analysis\_Demo.py** A [Jython](/scripting/jython) demo of how SNT can analyze neuronal reconstructions fetched from online databases such as MouseLight, NeuroMorpho or FlyCircuit.

- **Download\_ML\_Data.groovy** Exemplifies how to programmatically retrieve data from MouseLight's database at \[//ml-neuronbrowser.janelia.org ml-neuronbrowser.janelia.org\]: It iterates through all the neurons in the server and downloads data (both JSON and SWC formats) for cells with soma associated with the specified Allen Reference Atlas (ARA) compartment. Downloaded files will contain all metadata associated with the cell (i.e., labeling used, strain, etc.)

- **Get\_Branch\_Points\_in\_Brain\_Compartment.groovy** Exemplifies how to extract morphometric properties of a MouseLight cell associated with a specific brain region/neuropil compartment. Requires internet connection.

- **Graph\_Analysis.py** Demonstrates how to handle neurons as graph structures {% include wikipedia title="Graph theory" %} in which nodes connected by edges define the morphology of the neuron. SNT represents neurons as directed graphs (assuming the root -typically the soma- as origin) and allows data be processed using the powerful [jgrapht](https://jgrapht.org/) library. In this demo, the [graph diameter](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GraphDiameter.html) (i.e., the length of the longest shortest path or the longest graph geodesic) of a cellular compartment is computed for a neuron fetched from the MouseLight database.

- **Reconstruction\_Viewer\_Demo.py** Exemplifies how to render reconstructions and neuropil annotations in a stand-alone [Reconstruction Viewer](/plugins/snt/reconstruction-viewer).

- **SciView\_Demo.groovy** Exemplifies how bridge SNT with [sciview](/plugins/sciview).

- **Extensive\_Sholl\_Stats.groovy** Exemplifies how to perform linear and polynomial regression on tabular [Sholl](/plugins/sholl-analysis) data.

### Boilerplate

These scripts hold extensible boilerplate code in several programming languages, namely [BeanShell](/scripting/beanshell), [Groovy](/scripting/groovy) and [Jython](/scripting/jython). The most essential imports and [script parameters](/scripting/parameters) are included to facilitate rapid development.

### Tracing

- **Scripted\_Tracing\_Demo.py** Exemplifies how to programmatically perform A\* tracing between two points without GUI interaction, which allows for automated tracing of relatively simple structures (e.g., neurospheres neurites, microtubule bundles, etc). In this demo, points are retrieved from the SWC file of SNT's "demo tree", effectively recreating the initial SWC data.

- **Scripted\_Tracing\_Demo\_(Interactive).py** Exemplifies how to programmatically interact with a running instance of SNT to perform auto-tracing tasks.

- **Take\_Snapshot.py** Displays a WYSIWYG image of a tracing canvas. Exemplifies how to script SNT using SNTService.

### Batch

This menu hosts scripts that process files in bulk. Namely:

- **Convert\_Traces\_to\_SWC.py** Converts all .traces files in a directory into SWC.

- **Filter\_Multiple\_Images.py** Bulk filtering of image files using Frangi Vesselness.

- **Measure\_Multiple\_Files.py**/**Measure\_Multiple\_Files\_(With\_Options).groovy** Bulk measurements of reconstruction files.

- **Render\_Cell\_Collection.groovy** Exemplifies how to quickly render large collections of cells from a directory of files in [Reconstruction Viewer](/plugins/snt/reconstruction-viewer).

- **Render\_Cell\_Collection\_(MultiPanel\_Figure).groovy** Exemplifies how to generate a publication-quality multi-panel figure in which multiple reconstructions are sorted and color-coded by a specified morphometric trait (e.g., cable length).

# Python Notebooks

Direct access to the SNT API from the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language is made possible through the [PyImageJ](/scripting/pyimagej) module. This enables full integration between SNT and any library in the Python ecosystem (numpy, scipy, etc.). The [Notebooks](https://github.com/morphonets/SNT/tree/master/notebooks) directory in the SNT repository contains several examples at different complexity levels.

Here, we will only exemplify basic functionality. Please refer to the complete [examples](https://github.com/morphonets/SNT/tree/master/notebooks) for more details. Once the Python environment is properly [setup](https://github.com/morphonets/SNT/tree/master/notebooks#snt-notebooks), one can initialize Fiji:

{% highlight python %}
import imagej
ij = imagej.init('sc.fiji:fiji', mode='interactive')
{% endhighlight %}

Then, one import the needed SNT (Java) classes. E.g., to download a neuron reconstruction from the MouseLight database and calculate summary statistics on it, you would import the [MouseLightLoader](https://javadoc.scijava.org/SNT/index.html?sc/fiji/snt/io/MouseLightLoader.html) and [TreeStatistics](https://javadoc.scijava.org/SNT/index.html?sc/fiji/snt/analysis/TreeStatistics.html) classes:

{% highlight python %}
from scyjava import jimport
MouseLightLoader = jimport('sc.fiji.snt.io.MouseLightLoader')
TreeStatistics = jimport('sc.fiji.snt.analysis.TreeStatistics')
{% endhighlight %}

Now you can access all the attributes and methods these classes offer. Let's get a summary of the inter-node distances for a specific mouse cortical motor neuron (ID = "AA0100" in the [MouseLight database](https://ml-neuronbrowser.janelia.org/)).

{% highlight python %}
def run():
    loader = MouseLightLoader("AA0100")
    if not loader.isDatabaseAvailable():
        print("Could not connect to ML database", "Error")
        return
    if not loader.idExists():
        print("Somehow the specified id was not found", "Error")
        return

    a_tree = loader.getTree('axon', None) # compartment, color
    s_stats = TreeStatistics(a_tree)
    metric = TreeStatistics.INTER_NODE_DISTANCE
    summary_stats = s_stats.getSummaryStats(metric)
    s_stats.getHistogram(metric).show()
    print("The average inter-node distance is %d" % summary_stats.getMean())

{% endhighlight %}

# Examples

## Scripting Reconstruction Viewer

Programmatic control over an open instance of [Reconstruction Viewer](/plugins/snt/reconstruction-viewer) (either called from within SNT or as a standalone application) can be achieved by selecting the {% include bc path='Tools & Utilities|Script This Viewer...'%} [command](/plugins/snt/reconstruction-viewer#utilities). It will then open an instance of Fiji's script editor with a boilerplate template containing the most essential imports and [script parameters](/scripting/parameters). The default programming language for this template can be chosen from the drop-down menu of the *Preferred Language* [option](/plugins/snt/reconstruction-viewer#settings).

The following script exemplifies how to extend the boilerplate template to control the Viewer in real-time.
