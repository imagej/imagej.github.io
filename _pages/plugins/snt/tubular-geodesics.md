The Tubular Geodesics plugins were developed several years ago[1] for [Simple Neurite Tracer](SNT__FAQ#snt) but remain functional in modern [SNT](SNT). They can be installed manually as an SNT add-on. Once installed, they allow you to trace on a filtered-version of your image in which neuronal processes (or other tubular structures) are significantly enhanced using [ITK](ITK) segmentation. More details on the following pages:
