Important Note
--------------

<span style="color:#A52A2A"> ***Please Note: This version of the software is outdated. It will be part of Fiji for the time being, but I highly recommend using the new [Multiview Reconstruction Plugin](/plugins/multiview-reconstruction). It is much more powerful, flexible and completely integrated with the [BigDataViewer](BigDataViewer).*** </span>

Overview of the ***deprecated*** SPIM bead-based registration plugin
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The SPIM Registration plugin reconstructs an image from several input images, called views. For this reconstruction process some parameters defining the input and output data are required. The user has to define the naming convention of the input images, an approximate bead-brightness as well as the strategies for creating the fused output image.

### Creating a cropped output image

As the output images are typically very big (bounding box around all registered views) it is strongly recommended to define a cropping area where the imaged sample is positioned in the output image. As this is not possible in the first run, there is an option to first create a down-sampled version of the output image from which one can extract the cropping area. By running the plugin again and loading the previous registration parameters the cropped full-resolution output image can be created efficiently.

### Downloading example dataset

There is a 7-angle SPIM dataset of *Drosophila* available [here](http://fly.mpi-cbg.de/preibisch/nm/HisYFP-SPIM.zip). The cropping parameters pre-set in the plugin fit this dataset, only the appropriate folder has to be defined.

### System requirements

Multi-view SPIM datasets are typically rather large, therefore it is recommended to use the registration plugin on a computer with a lot of RAM. The minimal requirement for the example dataset is **at least 4Gb** of memory however we recommend an **8Gb** system. You may need to increase the Fiji memory limit by going to Edit-&gt;Options-&gt;Memory & Threads.

### Using the Plugins

There are three plugins which take those input parameters in different formats:

-   **[ SPIM Registration](SPIM_Registration#SPIM_Registration)**: Allows the registration of SPIM data with a subset of necessary options presented in the graphical user interface
-   **[ Multi-Channel SPIM Registration](SPIM_Registration#Multi-Channel_SPIM_Registration)**: Extends the [ SPIM Registration](SPIM_Registration#SPIM_Registration) to multiple channels and allows to override the z-stretching saved in the input files.
-   **[ Advanced SPIM Registration](SPIM_Registration#Advanced_SPIM_Registration)**: Registration of SPIM data using all possible options via loading a configuration file

### Processing a Time Lapse Acqusition

Processing a time lapse acquisition requires two steps. In the first step the registration for each individual timepoint has to be computed and will be automatically stored. Therefore, in the first pass, input the timepoints that should be processed in **Time Points to process** (e.g. 1-100), check **Register only (no fusion)** and uncheck **Timelapse processing**. After the registration is performed one timepoint has to be selected as reference timepoint, typically one with a low registration error. This timepoint should be fused to determine the **[ correct cropping area ](SPIM_Registration#Creating_a_cropped_output_image)** which will afterwards be applied to all other timepoints.

After all individual timepoints are registered and the cropping area is defined the plugin has to be called again. This time check **Timelapse Registration**, insert the **Reference Timepoint**, uncheck **Register only (no fusion)** and insert the coordinates of the cropping area of the reference timepoint. The created output images can be viewed for example with Plugins-&gt;Image5D-&gt;Virtual Image 5D Opener [1](https://imagej.net/plugins/image5d.html).

-   **SPIM Data Directory**: Fill in the directory name that contains all the image files. You can either drag&drop the directory, browse for it or type the name directly.

<!-- -->

-   **Time Points to process**: Define the timepoint(s) that should be processed. You can give single numbers (e.g. 18), enumerate (e.g. 1, 18, 19, 100), define ranges (e.g. 1-18) or combine all of them in any combination wanted (e.g. 1,2,10,20-50).

<!-- -->

-   **Pattern of SPIM files**: Define the naming convention of the input files by explaining how the angle and the timepoint is encoded into the filename. For example the file names are named in following way  
    *spim\_tl1\_angle0.lsm*, *spim\_tl1\_angle45.lsm* ... *spim\_tl1\_angle270.lsm*  
    *spim\_tl2\_angle0.lsm*, ... *spim\_tl2\_angle270.lsm*  
    *spim\_tl100\_angle0.lsm*, ... *spim\_tl100\_angle270.lsm*.  
    That means the pattern of the file names corresponds to **spim\_tl{t}\_angle{a}.lsm**, where **{t}** is replaced with the current timepoint and **{a}** with the current angle. If the numbers contain leading zeros (e.g. 000, 045, 090, 135 instead of 0, 45, 90, 135), this can be encoded by simply adding more letters to the placeholder, in this case **{aaa}**.

<!-- -->

-   **Angles to process**: Define the angles (at least 2) that should be processed (for each timepoint if applicable). You can enumerate angles (e.g. 0, 90, 180, 270), define ranges in steps (e.g. 0-270:45 which means use angle 0 to 270 in steps of 45, i.e. 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270) or combine all of them in any combination wanted (e.g. 0, 45, 180-270:45).

<!-- -->

-   **Timelapse processing**: Checked if a timelapse processing should be performed. In this case the **pre-registered** timepoints are re-registered to one reference timepoint which results in an aligned time series.

<!-- -->

-   **Reference Timepoint**: Define the reference timepoint for timelapse processing if timelapse processing above is checked.

<!-- -->

-   **Load segmented beads**: If the registration of the time point is carried out more than once (to recompute the registration) the initial segmentation of the beads can be loaded to speed up processing. Note: if **Load registration** is checked, **Load segmented beads** is implicitly checked as well.

<!-- -->

-   **Bead Brightness**: Define the brightness of the used beads relative to the sample.

<!-- -->

-   **Load Registration**: If the registration of the time point is carried out more than once (either to define the correct cropping area or to perform timelapse processing) the initial segmentation of the beads and the final affine matrices of the views can be loaded to speed up processing. Note: if **Load registration** is checked, **Load segmented beads** is implicitly checked as well and **Display registration** will be ignored.

<!-- -->

-   **Register only (no fusion)**: Checked if no fusion of the data should be performed.

<!-- -->

-   **Display registration**: This will display an interactive window visualizing the global optimization process. **Note:** This slows down the optimization.

<!-- -->

-   **Fusion Method**: There are three options available.  
    *Fuse all images at once* loads all the input images and computes the output image. This is the fastest method but it also needs significant amouts of RAM.  
    *Fuse images sequentially* loads one input image after the other and computes the contribution sequentially. This is significantly slower but typically uses less RAM. However, this methods needs to allocate the output image twice during the fusion process as it needs to store image content and weights separatetly.  
    *Create independent registered images* is a special output option where each view is transformed into a compatible bounding box and written as a separate file for further processing.

<!-- -->

-   **Fusion use Blending**: Checked if blending at the edges of the overlapping views should be applied; this removes brightness differences at the hyperplanes where the overlapping images intersect. **Note:** If neither Blending nor Content based Weightening is selected, only averaging is performed for fusion.

<!-- -->

-   **Fusion use Content based Weightening**: Checked if the content-based weightening should be used; this weights each pixel of each view by its local information content and thereby increases the contrast of the output image. **Note:** The content based weightening is rather fast but consumes a lot of RAM. If neither Blending nor Content based Weightening is selected, only averaging is performed for fusion.

<!-- -->

-   **Output Image Scaling**: The factor defines the downsampling of the output image, e.g. 2 means that the output image will be half as big in each dimension and therefore need 8x less RAM than the full resolution output image. This is especially useful if the bounding box around the imaged sample (defined below) is not known yet as has to be determined.

<!-- -->

-   **Crop Offset Output Image X/Y/Z**: Defines the cropping offset in the x/y/z-dimension of the output image relative to the uncropped image. A value of 0 means no cropping. **Note:** All the values are relative to the downsampling factor in **Output Image Scaling**.
-   **Crop Size Output Image X/Y/Z**: Defines the cropped size in the x/y/z-dimension of the output image relative to the uncropped image. A value of 0 means no cropping. **Note:** All the values are relative to the downsampling factor in **Output Image Scaling**.

-   Change Z-Stretching in Plugin
-   Automatic Timelapse processing
-   Preview (e.g. Max Projections of first angle) if register only checked and more than one timepoint

Multi-Channel SPIM Registration
-------------------------------

The multi-channel SPIM Registration extends the normal registration by the ability to register multiple channels and to override the resolution (xy, z) stored in the files. Therefore two new options are available

-   **Channels to process**: Define the channel(s) to process. You can give single numbers (e.g. 0), enumerate (e.g. 1, 2), define ranges (e.g. 1-3) or combine all of them in any combination wanted (e.g. 1,3-4).

<!-- -->

-   **Override file dimensions**: Check this box to override the axial and lateral resolution stored in the input files.

<!-- -->

-   **xy resolution (um/px)**: Define the xy-resolution in um per pixel, note that only the ratio between xy and z-resolution is used.

<!-- -->

-   **z resolution (um/px)**: Define the z-resolution in um per pixel, note that only the ratio between xy and z-resolution is used.
