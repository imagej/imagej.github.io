The **Sprout Morphology** plugin measures sprout *number*, *length*, *width* and *cell density* of endothelial cell (EC) sprouts grown in a bead sprouting assay. It optionally includes measuring the coverage of these sprouts with pericytes included in the assay, as well as the endothelial cell/pericyte ratio.

## Installation

To install the plugin, activate the **Angiogenesis** [update site](/update-sites/following) and restart Fiji.

## Usage

Open a maximum intensity projection of the multi-channel image to be analyzed, then start the plugin via {% include bc path='Analyze|Sprout Morphology'%}. The process consists of up to six dialogs:

### General configuration
