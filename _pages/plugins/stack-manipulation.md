Content and purpose
-------------------

This package regroups various "small" plugins dedicated to the manipulation of stacks, allowing to sort them, combine them, etc... As they are more of a utility package, they all can be found in the {% include bc content='Image | Stacks | Tools'%} menu, next to the ones provided by bare ImageJ.

What they do is pretty much summarized by the following diagram, taken from the [MBF ImageJ](/software/mbf-imagej) webpage.

-   The **Grouped ZProjector** acts a bit like the **Substack Maker**, for it allows to reduce the number of frame within a stack. But rather than taking a slice every certain step, it combines a group of slices and project them on a single slice. The size of the groups is configurable, and must be a divisor of the total number of slice.

-   The **Slice Keeper** does the opposite that of **Slice Remover**. Instead of removing every nth slice in a stack, it creates a new stack by only keeping every nth slice from the original stack.

### Interleave

### Slice Remover

This command lets you remove multiple slices in one go. You can specify a start slice, and end slice and an increment (i.e. start=1, end=5, increment=2 will remove the slices 1, 3 and 5). Warning: The Slice Remover treats hyperstacks as if they were converted via {% include bc content='Image | Hyperstacks | Hyperstack to Stack'%} first.

Original code by {% include person content='Rasband' %}.

### Slice Keeper

By Tony Collins, initially part of his wonderful [MBF Plugin Collection](/software/mbf-imagej) package. Tony mentioned credit should go to {% include person content='Rasband' %}, for the initial code is his work.
