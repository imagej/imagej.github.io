# Synaptic Activity in ImageJ (SynActJ)

SynActJ is an image and data analysis workflow that allows to analyze synaptic activity. 
It is based on a Fiji plugin and a R Shiny App that implement the automated image analysis of active synapses in time-lapse movies.
We tested the workflow with movies of pHluorin or calcium sensors.

## Core features
- Java Swing based graphical user interface
- Interactive adjustment over entire dataset
- Batch processing executed from main interface
- Saving and loading of processing settings
- Shiny App for data processing

## Accepted Datasets
Expected are 2D single channel .tif files containing multiple frames. At a specific frame the cultured neurons were stimulated and active boutons show an increase in intensity. The image calibration can be changed in the workflow. A settings file can be provided but can also be created later.

A small example file is provided here: [Link to example data](https://github.com/schmiedc/SynActJ/blob/master/testInput/testMovie.tif)

The default segmentation parameters should work for this example file.
