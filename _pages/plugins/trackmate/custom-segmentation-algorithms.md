## Introduction.

Up to the version 7 of [TrackMate](/plugins/trackmate/index), detection algorithms were limited to return the position of spots and their radius. All the detection were represented by a tuple in the shape of `frame, x, y, z, radius, quality`. This is well suited to implement _detection algorithms_, that return the position of an object but omit its shape. The [previous page](/plugins/trackmate/custom-detection-algorithms) in this tutorial series showed how the base code to implement such an algorithm as a detector for TrackMate.

With version 7, we rewrote a large part of TrackMate to remove this limitation, at least in 2D. We changed the data model so that `Spot`s in TrackMate could _possibly_ store the shape, while not affecting the exiting detectors. We made a new API to facilitate implementing _segmentation algorithms_ in TrackMate, that can return the shape of objects. Their shape is later used to compute morphology features or to measure intensity within the object contour. We used this API to implement [7 new segmentation algorithms](/plugins/trackmate/trackmate-v7-detectors) in TrackMate, integrating the some of the best segmentation tools available in Java. This page documents how you can use this API to implement your own segmentation algorithms yourself, and make it a first-class-citizen of TrackMate, like any of the other TrackMate modules we document in this series.

We need to first review the new API itself, which basically boils down to one class offering static methods. Then, as for the other detectors, we need to add some flags in the detector factory to tell TrackMate that what we build is a segmentation algorithm that returns the object shape. Finally, we will also see some find tuning of the multithreading for your detectors, made to accommodate the various existing segmentation tools you might want to integrate in TrackMate. We will use the examples of the 7 segmentation algorithms mentioned above to base this tutorial.

## Creating spots that store object contours. 

### What changed in the  `Spot` class.

Starting in version 7, the {% include github org='fiji' repo='TrackMate' branch='master' source='fiji/plugin/trackmate/Spot.java#L76-L81' label='Spot' %} class in TrackMate has a new field: a  {% include github org='fiji' repo='TrackMate' branch='master' source='fiji/plugin/trackmate/SpotRoi.java' label='SpotRoi' %} object.

It is basically made of the 2D polygon that stores the object contour, relative to the spot center (the `x, y, z` tuple). Its only fields are two `double[]` arrays for the `xp` and `yp` coordinates of the contour, ordered along the contour. The last point connects to the first.

The `Spot` objects returned by detection algorithms have the `SpotRoi` set to `null`. The sole difference of a segmentation algorithm in TrackMate is that it returns `Spot` objects with a non-`null` `SpotRoi` object.

### Limitations.

Let's start with the bad news: We can deal with object contours only for 2D images. The main reason is that we do not have yet a good way to store 3D contours in Fiji. This might change but for now all of what you will see only applies to 2D contours, so polygons.

Also, the object shape must be represented by a [simple polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_polygon). That is: the contour must not have holes, and the line of the polygons should not intersect each other. If you create a spot with an intersecting contour, the results are undefined. If you have objects with holes and you try to create spots for them, the holes will be ignored.

### Creating a `Spot` from a polygon.

The two `double[]` arrays for the `xp` and `yp` must be set relative to the spot X and Y position. You can compute them yourself, but it is easier to use the static method `createSpot()` that returns a spot from `x` and `y` in physical coordinates:

```java
double[] xp = ...;
double[] yp = ...;
double quality = ...;
Spot spotWithShape = SpotRoi.createSpot(xp, yp, quality);
```

As for all the coordinates stored in `Spot`, the X and Y must be in physical units (_e.g._ microns if your image is calibrated in microns). This method will take care of computing the spot `x` and `y` center, compute a radius from the polygon, and sore the contours points correctly.

### Example: How spots are created in the StarDist detector.

The [Fiji StarDist implementation](https://github.com/stardist/stardist-imagej/) returns the objects it found as polygons. We therefore just used this method to bridge it to TrackMate. In {% include github org='tinevez' repo='TrackMate-StarDist' branch='master' source='fiji/plugin/trackmate/stardist/StarDistDetector.java' label='StarDistDetector.java' %} you will find the following lines:

```java
/*
 * We received the 'polygons' object from the StarDist runner.
 * As for all the other detectors, this instance have to return
 * a list of Spot 'spots' containing all the objects segmented in 
 * the current time-point.
 */

// Create spots from output.
for ( final Integer polygonID : polygons.getWinner() )
{
    // Collect quality = max of proba.
    final PolygonRoi roi = polygons.getPolygonRoi( polygonID );
    proba.setRoi( roi );
    final double quality = proba.getStatistics( Measurements.MIN_MAX ).max;

    // Create ROI.
    final Polygon polygon = roi.getPolygon();
    final double[] xpoly = new double[ polygon.npoints ];
    final double[] ypoly = new double[ polygon.npoints ];
    for ( int i = 0; i < polygon.npoints; i++ )
    {
        /*
         * Here we convert the polygon points in pixel coordinates to 
         * physical coordinates (multiplication by the calibration).
         * We also need to offset them by the interval top-left corner
         * in case the user ask to perform segmentation in a sub-region
         * of the source image.
         */
        xpoly[ i ] = calibration[ 0 ] * ( interval.min( 0 ) + polygon.xpoints[ i ] );
        ypoly[ i ] = calibration[ 1 ] * ( interval.min( 1 ) + polygon.ypoints[ i ] );
    }
    Spot spot = SpotRoi.createSpot( xpoly, ypoly, quality );
    // 'spots' is the list of Spot this detector will return.
    spots.add( spot );
}
```

As you can see it is fairly simple. It illustrates how you can plug anything that returns a polygon in TrackMate and make a new detector out of it. If you want to integrate a technique that returns instead a mask, a probability map or a label image, we also made utility methods for these cases.

## Creating a collection of spots from a mask image or a threshold image.

### The `MaskUtils.fromThresholdWithROI()` method.

The above method is what you could use to implement your own segmentation algorithm. We also provide a simple API to facilitate integrating existing segmentation algorithms in TrackMate. Many of the existing algorithms either return a mask image, a label image or some sort of probability map to threshold to generate objects. 
This API consists mainly of utility methods in the class {% include github org='fiji' repo='TrackMate' branch='master' source='fiji/plugin/trackmate/detection/MaskUtils.java' label='MaskUtils' %} that accept such inputs and output a collection of `Spot`s, containing the object contour.
Let's start with how to input mask images.

For the maximal flexibility, a mask image in TrackMate can be of any type provided it is using a  scalar, real pixel type. We simply say that the objects are made by connecting all the pixels that have a value strictly larger than 0.
So the method that creates spots from such a mask is the one for importing a threshold image:

{% include github org='fiji' repo='TrackMate' branch='master' source='fiji/plugin/trackmate/detection/MaskUtils.java#L404-L439' label='MaskUtils.fromThresholdWithROI()' %}

```java
	/**
	 * Creates spots <b>with their ROIs</b> from a <b>2D</b> grayscale image,
	 * thresholded to create a mask. A spot is created for each
	 * connected-component of the mask, with a size that matches the mask size.
	 * The quality of the spots is read from another image, by taking the max
	 * pixel value of this image with the ROI.
	 * 
	 * @param <T>
	 *            the type of the input image. Must be real, scalar.
	 * @param <S>
	 *            the type of the quality image. Must be real, scalar.
	 * @param input
	 *            the input image. Must be 2D.
	 * @param interval
	 *            the interval in the input image to analyze.
	 * @param calibration
	 *            the physical calibration.
	 * @param threshold
	 *            the threshold to apply to the input image.
	 * @param simplify
	 *            if <code>true</code> the polygon will be post-processed to be
	 *            smoother and contain less points.
	 * @param numThreads
	 *            how many threads to use for multithreaded computation.
	 * @param qualityImage
	 *            the image in which to read the quality value.
	 * @return a list of spots, with ROI.
	 */
	public static final < T extends RealType< T >, S extends NumericType< S > > List< Spot > fromThresholdWithROI(
			final RandomAccessible< T > input,
			final Interval interval,
			final double[] calibration,
			final double threshold,
			final boolean simplify,
			final int numThreads,
			final RandomAccessibleInterval< S > qualityImage )
```

This method is suitable for 2D images. It will create spots with object contours. Let's review a bit its input:
* `input` is the mask input. It must be a `RandomAccessible` of type `T`, which is the classical frame that TrackMate automatically provides to its detectors. 
* `interval` is the interval in the input to analyze. Like for all other detectors, TrackMate returns the pixel infor as an unbounded `RandomAccessible` and we need to specify what part of the image we have to analyze. Again, this is common to all detectors and provided by TrackMate.
* `calibration` is a `double[]` array of 3 elements that contains the pixel size of the image (pixel width, height and depth). It is read from the input calibration that you can set in Fiji. Again, all of this is common to all detectors.
* `threshold` is a double value above above which intensities will be considered par of an object. This is spefic to this detector and is set by the user. For mask images, it is 0.
* `simplify` is a boolean flag that states whether the user requested the contours to be smoothed and simplified. This is important for measuring correctly morphological features and we document it fully elsewhere.
* `numThreads`. The creation of spots in this way is multithreaded and you can set here how many threads to use. Again, if you declare your detector to be `Multithreaded`, the `numThreads` value of your detector will be set automatically by TrackMate and you use it here. If your detector is not multithreaded, use a value of 1.
* The `qualityImage` is an image from which we will read a quality value for the spots created. It must be defined on the same interval that of the `interval` parameter, and the pixels must be of `NumericType` and scalar. If you cannot set the quality from a channel or an image (like for a mask), just pass `null` to this parameter and the quality valueof an object will be set to be its area. Otherwise it will be the maximal pixel value within the object contour in the quality image.

### Example: the mask detector.

Let's see how it is used on the mask detector. Since the mask images are treated simply as grayscale images with a threshold of 0, the mask detector is actually implemented in the {% include github org='fiji' repo='TrackMate' branch='master' source='fiji/plugin/trackmate/detection/ThresholdDetector.java' label='ThresholdDetector' %} class. (The {% include github org='fiji' repo='TrackMate' branch='master' source='fiji/plugin/trackmate/detection/MaskDetectorFactory.java' label='MaskDetectorFactory' %} returns a  `ThresholdDetector` with a threshold value set to 0. See {% include github org='fiji' repo='TrackMate' branch='master' source='fiji/plugin/trackmate/detection/MaskDetectorFactory.java#L89' label='this line' %}.)
Here is the content of the `process()` method:

```java
	@Override
	public boolean process()
	{
		final long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
		if ( input.numDimensions() == 2 )
		{
			/*
			 * 2D: we compute and store the contour.
			 */
			spots = MaskUtils.fromThresholdWithROI( input, interval, calibration, threshold, simplify, numThreads, null );

		}
		else if ( input.numDimensions() == 3 )
		{
			/*
			 * 3D: We create spots of the same volume that of the region.
			 */
			spots = MaskUtils.fromThreshold( input, interval, calibration, threshold, numThreads );
		}
		else
		{
			errorMessage = baseErrorMessage + "Required a 2D or 3D input, got " + input.numDimensions() + "D.";
			return false;
		}

		final long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
		this.processingTime = end - start;

		return true;
	}
```

Note that the detector treats differently 2D and 3D images. As stated above, the new API supports object contour only for 2D images. The method `MaskUtils.fromThreshold()` is the complement of the `MaskUtils.fromThresholdWithROI()` for 3D images, but that returns `Spot` objects that do not have a contour. Here the spots created have a radius that is such that the sphere with this radius have the same volume that of the segmented object.

The use of this API makes the detector code very short. You can imaging adapting the same approach to integrate a segmentation algorithm to would output a mask image or a threshold image. For instance this is what we did to integrate the _Traininable Weka segmentation_ plugin and the _ilastik_ pixel classifier.

### Example: the Weka detector.

The Weka detector is not very complicated. The bulk of calling Weka is done in the {% include github org='tinevez' repo='TrackMate-Weka' branch='master' source='fiji/plugin/trackmate/weka/WekaRunner.java' label='WekaRunner' %} class.
Running Weka is done in the {% include github org='tinevez' repo='TrackMate-Weka' branch='master' source='fiji/plugin/trackmate/weka/WekaRunner.java#L104-L107' label='WekaRunner.computeProbabilities()' %} method. It returns the probability of the classification for the specified input and the specified class. We won't detail it.
But creating spots from this probability is simple. The method {% include github org='tinevez' repo='TrackMate-Weka' branch='master' source='fiji/plugin/trackmate/weka/WekaRunner.java#L173-L198' label='WekaRunner.getSpots()' %} method, which resembles the method described in the previous paragraph:

```java
	public List< Spot > getSpots( final RandomAccessibleInterval< T > proba, final double[] calibration, final double threshold, final boolean simplify )
	{
		final List< Spot > spots;
		if ( isProcessing3D )
		{
			spots = MaskUtils.fromThreshold(
					proba,
					proba,
					calibration,
					threshold,
					numThreads,
					proba );
		}
		else
		{
			spots = MaskUtils.fromThresholdWithROI(
					proba,
					proba,
					calibration,
					threshold,
					simplify,
					numThreads,
					proba );
		}
		return spots;
	}
```
Here the threshold value to segment the probability map is set by the user.
Since we have a probability map, we can use it to compute a quality value derived from this probability.

### Example: the ilastik detector.

The ilastik detector works exactly in the same way. It has a  {% include github org='tinevez' repo='TrackMate-Ilastik' branch='master' source='fiji/plugin/trackmate/ilastik/IlastikRunner.java' label='IlastikRunner' %}  class that is in charge of calling ilastik and convert the results to a spot collection. The ilastik detector just makes a simple call to it.

However we use a special slicing of time-points for this algorithm. Indeed, the ilastik runner expects to receive _all_ the time-points to process at once, runs ilastik on them, and then return. We will discuss this in the next section.

Here is some explanation on the runner code:

```java
/*
 * This corresponds roughyl to the lines 94-110 of the IlastikRunner class.
 */

// Path to the ilastik project, provided by the users.
final File projectFile = new File( projectFilePath );

// Create an ilastik pixel classifier, configured with the classifier in the specified project.
final PixelClassification classifier = new PixelClassification(
  executableFilePath,
  projectFile,
  logService,
  statusService,
  numThreads,
  maxRamMb );
final PixelPredictionType predictionType = PixelPredictionType.Probabilities;

// Run the classifier on the 'cropped' source image. This will result in the PixelClassification
// Actually RUNNING ilastik in the background, passing input and output images as files saved
// in a temp folder. But this is transparent to us.
final ImgPlus< T > output = classifier.classifyPixels( cropped, predictionType );

// The output has one channel per class in the classifier, so we need to get the channel that
// contains the probability for our object of interest only (specified by the user via the classID 
// parameter).
final ImgPlus< T > proba = ImgPlusViews.hyperSlice( output, output.dimensionIndex( Axes.CHANNEL ), classId );

// Etc.
...
  
// Not we just have to import this probability map as TrackMate ROIs. Since we received the proba
// for ALL time-points at once, we need to process it time-point by time-point:
  
for ( int t = 0; t < proba.dimension( timeIndex ); t++ )
		{
			final List< Spot > spotsThisFrame;
			final ImgPlus< T > probaThisFrame = TMUtils.hyperSlice( proba, 0, t );

			if ( DetectionUtils.is2D( probaThisFrame ) )
			{
				/*
				 * 2D: we compute and store the contour.
				 */
				final boolean simplify = true;
        
        // In 2D we again use the MaskUtils utilities. Note that we use the '...WithROI()'
        // method version. In 2D we can import objects with their contours.
				spotsThisFrame = MaskUtils.fromThresholdWithROI(
						probaThisFrame,
						probaThisFrame,
						calibration, 
						probaThreshold, 
						simplify, 
						numThreads, 
						probaThisFrame );
			}
			else
			{
				/*
				 * 3D: We create spots of the same volume that of the region.
				 * So we use the methods without the '...WithROI()'.
				 */
				spotsThisFrame = MaskUtils.fromThreshold(
						probaThisFrame,
						probaThisFrame,
						calibration,
						probaThreshold,
						numThreads,
						probaThisFrame );
			}
  // etc...
```

## Controlling the slicing of time-points.

Normally TrackMate automates the multi-threading processing of several time-points. When you develop a detector, a `SpotDetector` instance is supposed to operate only on one time-point. The processing logic in TrackMate will take care of providing a single time-point image to this detector and incorporate the detection results into the correct place in the `SpotCollection`.

But because we wanted to integrate with algorithms and tools such as ilastik, we needed to provide another way of handling time-points. For instance, ilastik expects to receive all the time-points at once, process them, and return the probabilities for all time-points as well. This is considerably faster than calling ilastik several times, once per time-point.

So starting with v7, there is a new hierarchy for `SpotDetectorFactory` in TrackMate:

### `SpotDetectorFactory`

{% include github org='fiji' repo='TrackMate' branch='master' source='fiji/plugin/trackmate/detection/SpotDetectorFactory.java' label='SpotDetectorFactory' %} is the initial interface for spot detector factories that generate one detector per time-point. It is will suited to detection and segmentation algorithms that can run concurrently on several time-points at once without a penalty too large. All detectors I know of, except the ilastik detector, derive from this interface.

Note that its only specific method is the following:

```java
	/**
	 * Returns a new {@link SpotDetector} configured to operate on the given
	 * target frame. This factory must be first given the <code>ImgPlus</code>
	 * and the settings map, through the <code>#setTarget(ImgPlus, Map)</code>
	 * method.
	 *
	 * @param interval
	 *            the interval that determines the region in the source image to
	 *            operate on. This must <b>not</b> have a dimension for time
	 *            (<i>e.g.</i> if the source image is 2D+T (3D), then the
	 *            interval must be 2D; if the source image is 3D without time,
	 *            then the interval must be 3D).
	 * @param frame
	 *            the frame index in the source image to operate on
	 */
	public SpotDetector< T > getDetector( final Interval interval, int frame );
```

So it will generate a `SpotDetector` instance per time-point. Such a detector has for output a `List< Spot >`, which is expected to contain only the spots it found in the frame it is configured to run on. TrackMate will take care of assembling all the `List< Spot >` from different time-point in a `SpotCollection`.

### `SpotGlobalDetectorFactory`

{% include github org='fiji' repo='TrackMate' branch='master' source='fiji/plugin/trackmate/detection/SpotGlobalDetectorFactory.java' label='SpotGlobalDetectorFactory' %} is a new interface that does not slice time-points. Its unique specific method returns a `SpotGlobalDetector` that is expected to process *all* time-points at once. Such a detector is instantiated only once per detector run.

```java
	/**
	 * Returns a new {@link SpotDetector} configured to operate on all the
	 * time-points. This factory must be first given the <code>ImgPlus</code>
	 * and the settings map, through the <code>#setTarget(ImgPlus, Map)</code>
	 * method.
	 *
	 * @param interval
	 *            the interval that determines the region in the source image to
	 *            operate on. This must <b>not</b> have a dimension for time
	 *            (<i>e.g.</i> if the source image is 2D+T (3D), then the
	 *            interval must be 2D; if the source image is 3D without time,
	 *            then the interval must be 3D).
	 */
	public SpotGlobalDetector< T > getDetector( final Interval interval );
```

The `SpotGlobalDetector` outputs a `SpotCollection`, that is expected to contain all the spots in all time-point of the movie.

### The base `SpotDetectorFactoryBase` interface and the `has2Dsegmentation` flag.

The two interfaces above derive from a mother interface that contains common methods: {% include github org='fiji' repo='TrackMate' branch='master' source='fiji/plugin/trackmate/detection/SpotDetectorFactoryBase.java' label='SpotDetectorFactoryBase' %}. It contains a very important method if are building a segmentation algorithm for TrackMate:

```java
	/**
	 * Return <code>true</code> for the detectors that can provide a spot with a
	 * 2D <code>SpotRoi</code> when they operate on 2D images.
	 * <p>
	 * This flag may be used by clients to exploit the fact that the spots
	 * created with this detector will have a contour that can be used
	 * <i>e.g.</i> to compute morphological features. The default is
	 * <code>false</code>, indicating that this detector provides spots as a X,
	 * Y, Z, radius tuple.
	 * 
	 * @return <code>true</code> if the spots created by this detector have a 2D
	 *         contour.
	 */
	public default boolean has2Dsegmentation()
	{
		return false;
	}
```

If your detector can return the spot shape for 2D images, override this method so that it returns true. This is important to let TrackMate know it should compute morphological features on the spot this detector created. If you don't see the morphological features in the GUI (Area, ...) this is most likely because of this method.

As you can see in the examples above in this page, the new detectors return true for this method.
