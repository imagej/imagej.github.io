{% include extendingtrackmatetutorials%}


Introduction
------------

This article is the second in the series dedicated to extending TrackMate with your own modules. Here we focus on creating **feature analyzers**: small algorithms that calculate one or several numerical values for the TrackMate results. The [previous article](/plugins/trackmate/custom-edge-feature-analyzer-algorithms) focused on writing edge analyzers: algorithms that allocate a numerical value to the link between two spots.

In this article, we will create a **feature analyzer for tracks** that calculate numerical values for whole tracks. To make it simple, and also to answer the request of a colleague, we will make an analyzer that reports the location of the starting and ending points of a track.

Actually, we will not learn much beyond what we saw previously. The only little change is that our analyzer will generate 6 numerical values instead of 1. We will use the [SciJava](SciJava) discovery mechanism as before, but just for the sake of it, we will introduce how to **disable** modules.

Track analyzers
---------------

All the track feature analyzers must implement {% include github org='fiji' repo='TrackMate' source='fiji/plugin/trackmate/features/track/TrackAnalyzer.java' label='TrackAnalyzer interface' %}. Like for the {% include github org='fiji' repo='TrackMate' source='fiji/plugin/trackmate/features/edges/EdgeAnalyzer.java' label='EdgeAnalyzer' %} interface, it extends both

-   {% include github org='fiji' repo='TrackMate' source='fiji/plugin/trackmate/features/FeatureAnalyzer.java' label='FeatureAnalyzer' %} that helps you declaring what you compute,
-   and {% include github org='fiji' repo='TrackMate' source='fiji/plugin/trackmate/plugins/trackmateModule.java' label='TrackMateModule' %}, that is in charge of the integration in TrackMate.

The only changes for us are two methods specific to tracks:

    public void process( final Collection< Integer > trackIDs, final Model model );

the does the actual feature calculation for the specified tracks, and

    public boolean isLocal();

that specified whether the calculation of the features for one track affects only this track or all the tracks. For the discussion on local *vs* non-local feature analyzers, I report you to the [previous article item](/plugins/trackmate/custom-edge-feature-analyzer-algorithms#isLocal.28.29).

Track feature analyzer header
-----------------------------

Like all TrackMate modules, you need to annotate your class to make it discoverable by TrackMate. It takes the following shape:

    @Plugin( type = TrackAnalyzer.class )
    public class TrackStartSpotAnalyzer implements TrackAnalyzer
    {
            // etc...

and that's good enough.

Declaring features
------------------

Declaring the features your provide is done as before. This time, a single analyzer returns 6 values, so you need to declare them. Here is the related code:

    @Plugin( type = TrackAnalyzer.class )
    public class TrackStartSpotAnalyzer implements TrackAnalyzer
    {

        private static final String KEY = "TRACK_START_SPOT_ANALYZER";

        public static final String TRACK_START_X = "TRACK_START_X";

        public static final String TRACK_START_Y = "TRACK_START_Y";

        public static final String TRACK_START_Z = "TRACK_START_Z";

        public static final String TRACK_STOP_X = "TRACK_STOP_X";

        public static final String TRACK_STOP_Y = "TRACK_STOP_Y";

        public static final String TRACK_STOP_Z = "TRACK_STOP_Z";

        private static final List< String > FEATURES = new ArrayList< String >( 6 );

        private static final Map< String, String > FEATURE_SHORT_NAMES = new HashMap< String, String >( 6 );

        private static final Map< String, String > FEATURE_NAMES = new HashMap< String, String >( 6 );

        private static final Map< String, Dimension > FEATURE_DIMENSIONS = new HashMap< String, Dimension >( 6 );

        static
        {
            FEATURES.add( TRACK_START_X );
            FEATURES.add( TRACK_START_Y );
            FEATURES.add( TRACK_START_Z );
            FEATURES.add( TRACK_STOP_X );
            FEATURES.add( TRACK_STOP_Y );
            FEATURES.add( TRACK_STOP_Z );

            FEATURE_NAMES.put( TRACK_START_X, "Track start X" );
            FEATURE_NAMES.put( TRACK_START_Y, "Track start Y" );
            FEATURE_NAMES.put( TRACK_START_Z, "Track start Z" );
            FEATURE_NAMES.put( TRACK_STOP_X, "Track stop X" );
            FEATURE_NAMES.put( TRACK_STOP_Y, "Track stop Y" );
            FEATURE_NAMES.put( TRACK_STOP_Z, "Track stop Z" );

            FEATURE_SHORT_NAMES.put( TRACK_START_X, "X start" );
            FEATURE_SHORT_NAMES.put( TRACK_START_Y, "Y start" );
            FEATURE_SHORT_NAMES.put( TRACK_START_Z, "Z start" );
            FEATURE_SHORT_NAMES.put( TRACK_STOP_X, "X stop" );
            FEATURE_SHORT_NAMES.put( TRACK_STOP_Y, "Y stop" );
            FEATURE_SHORT_NAMES.put( TRACK_STOP_Z, "Z stop" );

            FEATURE_DIMENSIONS.put( TRACK_START_X, Dimension.POSITION );
            FEATURE_DIMENSIONS.put( TRACK_START_Y, Dimension.POSITION );
            FEATURE_DIMENSIONS.put( TRACK_START_Z, Dimension.POSITION );
            FEATURE_DIMENSIONS.put( TRACK_STOP_X, Dimension.POSITION );
            FEATURE_DIMENSIONS.put( TRACK_STOP_Y, Dimension.POSITION );
            FEATURE_DIMENSIONS.put( TRACK_STOP_Z, Dimension.POSITION );
        }
            
        /*
         * FEATUREANALYZER METHODS
         */

        @Override
        public List< String > getFeatures()
        {
            return FEATURES;
        }

        @Override
        public Map< String, String > getFeatureShortNames()
        {
            return FEATURE_SHORT_NAMES;
        }

        @Override
        public Map< String, String > getFeatureNames()
        {
            return FEATURE_NAMES;
        }

        @Override
        public Map< String, Dimension > getFeatureDimensions()
        {
            return FEATURE_DIMENSIONS;
        }

Let's compute them now.

Accessing tracks in TrackMate
-----------------------------

In the previous article, we went maybe a bit quickly on how to access data in TrackMate. This is not the goal of this series, but here is a quick recap:

All the track structure is stored in a sub-component of the model called the {% include github org='fiji' repo='TrackMate' source='fiji/plugin/trackmate/TrackModel.java' label='TrackModel' %}. It stores the collection of links between two spots that builds a graph, and has some rather complex logic to maintain a list of connected components: the tracks.

The tracks themselves are indexed by their ID, stored as an `int`, that has no particular meaning. Once you have the ID of track, you can get the spots it contains with

    trackModel.trackSpots( trackID )

and its links (or edges) with

    trackModel.trackEdges( trackID )

Let's exploit this.

Calculating the position of start and end points
------------------------------------------------

Well, it is just about retrieving a track and identifying its starting and end points. Here is the whole code for the processing method:


        @Override
        public void process( final Collection< Integer > trackIDs, final Model model )
        {
            // The feature model where we store the feature values:
            final FeatureModel fm = model.getFeatureModel();

            // Loop over all the tracks we have to process.
            for ( final Integer trackID : trackIDs )
            {
                // The tracks are indexed by their ID. Here is how to get their
                // content:
                final Set< Spot > spots = model.getTrackModel().trackSpots( trackID );
                // Or .trackEdges( trackID ) if you want the edges.

                // This set is NOT ordered. If we want the first one and last one we
                // have to sort them:
                final Comparator< Spot > comparator = Spot.frameComparator;
                final List< Spot > sorted = new ArrayList< Spot >( spots );
                Collections.sort( sorted, comparator );

                // Extract and store feature values.
                final Spot first = sorted.get( 0 );
                fm.putTrackFeature( trackID, TRACK_START_X, Double.valueOf( first.getDoublePosition( 0 ) ) );
                fm.putTrackFeature( trackID, TRACK_START_Y, Double.valueOf( first.getDoublePosition( 1 ) ) );
                fm.putTrackFeature( trackID, TRACK_START_Z, Double.valueOf( first.getDoublePosition( 2 ) ) );

                final Spot last = sorted.get( sorted.size() - 1 );
                fm.putTrackFeature( trackID, TRACK_STOP_X, Double.valueOf( last.getDoublePosition( 0 ) ) );
                fm.putTrackFeature( trackID, TRACK_STOP_Y, Double.valueOf( last.getDoublePosition( 1 ) ) );
                fm.putTrackFeature( trackID, TRACK_STOP_Z, Double.valueOf( last.getDoublePosition( 2 ) ) );

                // Et voilà!
            }
        }

The whole code for the analyzer can be found {% include github org='fiji' repo='TrackMate-examples' source='plugin/trackmate/examples/trackanalyzer/TrackStartSpotAnalyzer.java' label='here' %}.

Wrapping up
-----------

Et ca marche !

In the next article we will build a spot analyzer and complicate things a bit, by introducing the notion of *priority*. But before this, a short word on how to disable a module.

How to disable a module
-----------------------

Suppose you have in your code tree a TrackMate module you wish not to use anymore. The trivial way would be to delete its class, but here is another one what allows us to introduce [SciJava](SciJava) plugin annotation parameters.

The `@Plugin( type = TrackAnalyzer.class )` annotation accepts extra parameters on top of the `type` one. They all take the shape of a `key = value` pair, and a few of them allow the fine tuning of the TrackMate module integration.

The first one we will see is the `enabled` value. It accepts a `boolean` as value and by default it is `true`. Its usage is obvious:

{% include ambox text='If you want to disable a TrackMate module, add the `enabled = false` annotation parameter.' %}

Like this:

    @Plugin( type = TrackAnalyzer.class, enabled = false )

Disabled modules are not even instantiated. They are as good as dead, except that you can change your mind easily. By the way, you can see that the TrackMate source tree has many of these disabled modules...
