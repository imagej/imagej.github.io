Purpose
-------

This plugin implements the find maxima detection algorithm for [TrackMate](/plugins/trackmate). It was tried to resample the approach as for the *Process -&gt; Find Maxima...* command. The results are almost the same. Subpixel accuracy is activated by default.

Installation
------------

Copy the jar file into your fiji plugins folder. If you start TrackMate it is detected automatically and you can choose it as detector.

Parameters

**Estimated blob diameter:** To achieve subpixel accuracy this region is used for refining the positions.

**Tolerance:** As for the *Process -&gt; Find Maxima...* command: "Maxima are ignored if they do not stand out from the surroundings by more than this value. In other words, a threshold is set at the maximum value minus noise tolerance and the contiguous area around the maximum above the threshold is analyzed. For accepting a maximum, this area must not contain any point with a value higher than the maximum. Only one maximum within this area is accepted."

Example
-------

The example shows a typical image of scattering nanoparticles. The detection was done with a **estimated blob diameter** of 10 and **tolerance** of 10: ![](/media/Findmax result.png "fig:Findmax_result.png")
