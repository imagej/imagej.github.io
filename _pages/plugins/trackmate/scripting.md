TrackMate scripting principle
-----------------------------

[TrackMate\_](/plugins/trackmate) can also be used without the GUI, using a scripting language that allows making calls to Java. The most simple way to get started is to use the [Script Editor](/scripting/script-editor), which takes care of the difficult & boring part for you (such as path). The examples proposed on this page all use Jython, but can be adapted to anything.

Since we are calling the internals of TrackMate, we must get to know a bit of its guts. I have tried to come up with a rational design; though not always successfully. There is 3 main classes to interact with in a script:

-   Model ([`fiji.plugin.trackmate.Model`](https://fiji.sc/javadoc/fiji/plugin/trackmate/Model.html)) is the class in charge of <u>storing the data</u>. It cannot do anything to create it. It can help you follow manual modifications you would made in the manual editing mode, interrogate it, ... but it is conceptually just a data recipient.

<!-- -->

-   Settings ([`fiji.plugin.trackmate.Settings`](https://fiji.sc/javadoc/fiji/plugin/trackmate/Settings.html)) is the class storing the fields that will configure TrackMate and pilot how the data is created. This is where you specify what is the source image, what are the detector and tracking algorithms to use, what are the filters to use, etc...

<!-- -->

-   TrackMate (\[https://fiji.sc/javadoc/fiji/plugin/trackmate/TrackMate.html>`fiji.plugin.trackmate.TrackMate`\]) is the guy that does the actual work. In scripts, we use it to actually <u>perform the analysis tasks</u, such as generating spots from images, linking them into track, etc... It reads configuration information in the Settings object mentioned above and put the resulting data in the model.

So getting a working script is all about configuring a proper `Settings` object and calling `exec*` methods on a `TrackMate` object. Then we read the results in the `Model` object.

A full example
--------------

Here is an example of full tracking process, using the easy image found in the [first tutorial](/plugins/trackmate/getting-started). The following (Jython) script works as following:

-   It fetches the image from the web
-   It configures settings for segmentation and tracking
-   The model is instantiated, with the settings and imp objects
-   The [TrackMate](/plugins/trackmate) class is instantiated with the model object
-   Then the [TrackMate](/plugins/trackmate) object performs all the steps needed.
-   The final results is displayed as an overlay.

Loading and reading from a saved TrackMate XML file
---------------------------------------------------

Scripting is a good way to interrogate and play non-interactively with tracking results. The example below shows how to load a XML TrackMate file and rebuild a full working model from it.

That way you could for instance redo a full tracking process by only changing one parameter with respect to the saved one. You might also want to check results without relying on the GUI. Etc...

For the example below to work for you, you will have to edit line 20 and put the actual path to your TrackMate file.

    from fiji.plugin.trackmate.visualization.hyperstack import HyperStackDisplayer
    from fiji.plugin.trackmate.io import TmXmlReader
    from fiji.plugin.trackmate import Logger
    from fiji.plugin.trackmate import Settings
    from fiji.plugin.trackmate import SelectionModel
    from fiji.plugin.trackmate.providers import DetectorProvider
    from fiji.plugin.trackmate.providers import TrackerProvider
    from fiji.plugin.trackmate.providers import SpotAnalyzerProvider
    from fiji.plugin.trackmate.providers import EdgeAnalyzerProvider
    from fiji.plugin.trackmate.providers import TrackAnalyzerProvider
    from java.io import File
    import sys


    #----------------
    # Setup variables
    #----------------

    # Put here the path to the TrackMate file you want to load
    file = File('/Users/tinevez/Desktop/Data/FakeTracks.xml')

    # We have to feed a logger to the reader.
    logger = Logger.IJ_LOGGER

    #-------------------
    # Instantiate reader
    #-------------------

    reader = TmXmlReader(file)
    if not reader.isReadingOk():
        sys.exit(reader.getErrorMessage())
    #-----------------
    # Get a full model
    #-----------------

    # This will return a fully working model, with everything
    # stored in the file. Missing fields (e.g. tracks) will be
    # null or None in python
    model = reader.getModel()
    # model is a fiji.plugin.trackmate.Model

    #----------------
    # Display results
    #----------------

    # We can now plainly display the model. It will be shown on an
    # empty image with default magnification.
    sm = SelectionModel(model)
    displayer =  HyperStackDisplayer(model, sm)
    displayer.render()

    #---------------------------------------------
    # Get only part of the data stored in the file
    #---------------------------------------------

    # You might want to access only separate parts of the
    # model.

    spots = model.getSpots()
    # spots is a fiji.plugin.trackmate.SpotCollection

    logger.log(str(spots))

    # If you want to get the tracks, it is a bit trickier.
    # Internally, the tracks are stored as a huge mathematical
    # simple graph, which is what you retrieve from the file.
    # There are methods to rebuild the actual tracks, taking
    # into account for everything, but frankly, if you want to
    # do that it is simpler to go through the model:

    trackIDs = model.getTrackModel().trackIDs(True) # only filtered out ones
    for id in trackIDs:
        logger.log(str(id) + ' - ' + str(model.getTrackModel().trackEdges(id)))


    #---------------------------------------
    # Building a settings object from a file
    #---------------------------------------

    # Reading the Settings object is actually currently complicated. The
    # reader wants to initialize properly everything you saved in the file,
    # including the spot, edge, track analyzers, the filters, the detector,
    # the tracker, etc...
    # It can do that, but you must provide the reader with providers, that
    # are able to instantiate the correct TrackMate Java classes from
    # the XML data.

    # We start by creating an empty settings object
    settings = Settings()

    # Then we create all the providers, and point them to the target model:
    detectorProvider        = DetectorProvider()
    trackerProvider         = TrackerProvider()
    spotAnalyzerProvider    = SpotAnalyzerProvider()
    edgeAnalyzerProvider    = EdgeAnalyzerProvider()
    trackAnalyzerProvider   = TrackAnalyzerProvider()

    # Ouf! now we can flesh out our settings object:
    reader.readSettings(settings, detectorProvider, trackerProvider, spotAnalyzerProvider, edgeAnalyzerProvider, trackAnalyzerProvider)

    logger.log(str('\n\nSETTINGS:'))
    logger.log(str(settings))

    # The settings object is also instantiated with the target image.
    # Note that the XML file only stores a link to the image.
    # If the link is not valid, the image will not be found.
    imp = settings.imp
    imp.show()

    # With this, we can overlay the model and the source image:
    displayer =  HyperStackDisplayer(model, sm, imp)
    displayer.render()

Export spot, edge and track numerical features after tracking
-------------------------------------------------------------

This example shows how to extract numerical features from tracking results.

TrackMate computes and stores three kind of numerical features:

-   Spot features, such as a spot location (X, Y, Z), its mean intensity, radius etc...
-   Edge or link features: An edge is a link between two spots. Its feature typically stores the velocity and displacement, which are defined only for two consecutive spots in the same track.
-   Track features: numerical features that apply to a whole track, such as the number of spots it contains.

By default, TrackMate only computes a very limited number of features. The GUI forces TrackMate to compute them all, but if you do scripting, you will have to explicitly configures TrackMate to compute the features you desire. This is done by adding feature analyzers to the settings object.

There are some gotchas: some feature analyzers require other numerical features to be already calculated. If something does not work, it is a good idea to directly check the preamble in the source code of the analyzers ([TrackMate feature logic](https://github.com/fiji/TrackMate/blob/master/src/main/java/fiji/plugin/trackmate/features/)).

Finally, depending on their type, numerical features are not stored at the same place:

-   Spot features are simply conveyed by the spot object, and you can access them through `spot.getFeature('FEATURE_NAME')`
-   Edge and track features are stored in a sub-component of the model object called the FeatureModel ({% include github repo='fiji' path='src-plugins/TrackMate\_/src/main/java/fiji/plugin/trackmate/FeatureModel.java' label='FeatureModel.java' %}).

Manually creating a model
-------------------------

TrackMate aims at combining automatic and manual tracking facilities. This is also the case when scripting: a part of the API offers to a edit a model extensively. A few code patterns must be followed.

First, every edit must happen between a call to `model.beginUpdate()` and `model.endUpdate()`:

    model.beginUpdate()
    # ... do whatever you want to the model here.
    model.endUpdate()

The reason for this is that TrackMate caches each modification made to its model. This is required because we can deal with a rather complex content. For instance: imagine you have a single track that splits in two branches at some point. If you decide to remove the spot at the fork, a complex series of events will happen:

-   First, three edges will be removed: the ones that were connected to the spot you just removed.
-   Then the spot will actually be removed from the model.
-   But then you need to recompute the tracks, because now, you have 3 tracks instead of 1.
-   But also: all the numerical features of the tracks are now invalid, and you need to recompute them.
-   And what happens to the track name? What track, amongst the 3 new ones, will receive the old name?

Well, TrackMate does that for you automatically, but for the chain of events to happen timely, you must make your edits within this `model.beginUpdate() / model.endUpdate()` code block.

This script just shows you how to use this construct to build and populate a model from scratch. Appending content to a model is done by, sequentially:

-   Creating spot objects. You have to provide their x, y, z location, as well as a radius and a quality value for each. At this stage, you don't provide at what frame (or time) they belong.
-   This is done by adding the spot to the model, using `model.addSpotTo(Spot, frame)`, frame being a positive integer number.
-   Then you create a link, or an edge as it is called in TrackMate, between two spots. You have to provide the link cost: `model.addEdge(Spot1, Spot2, cost)`.

Spot quality and link cost are typically useful to quantify automatic spot detection and linking. We typically use negative values for these two numbers when doing manual edits.

Calling TrackMate with multi-channel analyzer
---------------------------------------------

TrackMate allows for the addition of jar files that contain extra TrackMate modules. The [multi-channel spot mean intensity analyzer](TrackMate#Downloadable_jars) is such a module.

As any other module it can be used in a script, provided the jar file is in the plugins or jars folder of Fiji:

{% include github-embed org='fiji' repo='TrackMate' source='../../../scripts/CallTrackMateMultiChannel.py' %}

Making TrackMate macro recordable with a 64-line script
-------------------------------------------------------

Contributed by {% include person content='Eglinger' %} during a NEUBIAS course. Quoting from Jan:

> "The macro language is too limited to work with such awesome things as TrackMate, but that you can do everything with a more powerful scripting language. So when using a 64-line script to call it, it actually is macro recordable."

{% include github-embed org='fiji' repo='TrackMate' source='../../../scripts/Run\_TrackMate\_Headless.groovy' %}

Add 3D maximas in the ROI Manager using TrackMate
-------------------------------------------------

Using the 3D spots finder of TrackMate, it is possible to add the maximas to the ROI Manager with a simple Jython code:

    # @ImagePlus imp

    # Imports
    from fiji.plugin.trackmate.detection import LogDetector
    from net.imglib2.img.display.imagej import ImageJFunctions

    from ij.plugin.frame import RoiManager
    from ij.gui import PointRoi

    # Set the parameters for LogDetector
    img = ImageJFunctions.wrap(imp)
    interval = img
    cal = imp.getCalibration()
    # Get the calibration from the metadata if exists
    calibration = [cal.pixelWidth, cal.pixelHeight, cal.pixelDepth]

    # Values to enter based on the TrackMate GUI
    radius = 5  # the radius is half the diameter
    threshold = 1050
    doSubpixel = True
    doMedian = True


    # Setup spot detector (see http://javadoc.imagej.net/Fiji/fiji/plugin/trackmate/detection/LogDetector.html)
    #
    # public LogDetector(RandomAccessible<T> img,
    #            Interval interval,
    #            double[] calibration,
    #            double radius,
    #            double threshold,
    #            boolean doSubPixelLocalization,
    #            boolean doMedianFilter)

    detector = LogDetector(img, interval, calibration, radius, threshold, doSubpixel, doMedian)

    # Start processing and display the results
    if detector.process():
        # Get the list of peaks found
        peaks = detector.getResult()
        print str(len(peaks)), "peaks were found."

        # Add points to ROI manager
        rm = RoiManager.getInstance()
        if not rm:
            rm = RoiManager()

        # Loop through all the peak that were found
        for peak in peaks:
            # Print the current coordinates
            print peak.getDoublePosition(0), peak.getDoublePosition(1), peak.getDoublePosition(2)
            # Add the current peak to the Roi manager
            roi = PointRoi(peak.getDoublePosition(0) / cal.pixelWidth, peak.getDoublePosition(1) / cal.pixelHeight)
            # Set the Z position of the peak otherwise the peaks are all set on the same slice
            roi.setPosition(int(round(peak.getDoublePosition(2) / cal.pixelDepth))+1)
            rm.addRoi(roi)
        # Show all ROIs on the image
        rm.runCommand(imp, "Show All")

    else:
        print "The detector could not process the data."

Tracking spots that are taken from the ROI manager.
---------------------------------------------------

You have to start from a 2D+T image (nothing else) and a results table that contains at least the center of mass XM, YM, the slice and the Area for the cells in the movie. The results table is typically generated from the ROI manager, that would contain the results of the particle analyzer.

So an ideal starting situation would like this:

<img src="/media/TrackMateScriptBeforeCapture.png" width="600"/>

this script will generate the following tracks:

https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business4/uploads/imagej/original/3X/c/3/c3cee76938213f8d3e43ae1ca4cfbe3e4453546e.gif

Cool no? The output can be controlled via a TrackMate GUI that will be shown upon running the script. Showing the GUI might not be desirable in batch mode, but from the GUI you can save your data, export to IJ tables and save to CSV, export a movie etc.

The script also offers to color the ROIs by track ID, if you have the ROI manager that was used to create the results table. It looks like this:

        We retrieve the IJ ROI that matches the TrackMate Spot because in the
        latter we stored the index of the spot in the quality feature. This
        is a hack of course. On top of that, it supposes that the index of the
        ROI in the ROIManager corresponds to the line in the ResultsTable it
        generated. So any changes to the ROIManager or the ResultsTable is
        likely to break things.
