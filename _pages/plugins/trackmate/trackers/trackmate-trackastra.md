TrackMate integration of the **Trackastra** transformer-based tracking algorithm, by Benjamin Gallusser and Martin Weigert. 
If you use this tracker in your work, please be so kind as to cite the paper that describes it:

## Installation

### Install Trackastra

To use this tracker in TrackMate, you first need a working installation of Trackastra on your computer.
Please follow the instructions on the GitHub repository of Trackastra:
[https://github.com/weigertlab/trackastra?tab=readme-ov-file#installation](https://github.com/weigertlab/trackastra?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

The integration needs at least the version 0.2.2 of Trackastra.

Once done, let's test that it works. 
Supposing that you created a conda environment name `trackastra`, type the following in a terminal:

```sh
> conda activate trackastra
> trackastra track --help
```
This should print:
```sh
usage: trackastra track [-h] -i IMGS -m MASKS [--output-ctc OUTPUT_CTC] [--output-edge-table OUTPUT_EDGE_TABLE] [--model-pretrained MODEL_PRETRAINED] [--model-custom MODEL_CUSTOM]
                        [--mode {greedy_nodiv,greedy,ilp}] [--device {cuda,cpu}]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i IMGS, --imgs IMGS  Directory with series of .tif files.
  -m MASKS, --masks MASKS
                        Directory with series of .tif files.
  --output-ctc OUTPUT_CTC
                        If set, write results in CTC format to this directory.
  --output-edge-table OUTPUT_EDGE_TABLE
                        If set, write results as an edge table in CSV format to the given file.
  --model-pretrained MODEL_PRETRAINED
                        Name of pretrained Trackastra model.
  --model-custom MODEL_CUSTOM
                        Local folder with custom model.
  --mode {greedy_nodiv,greedy,ilp}
  --device {cuda,cpu}
```

### Configure conda path in Fiji

{% include notice icon="warning"
  content="You need to do the following only on **MacOS** and on **Linux**. On Windows, you can skip this step." %}

Because this integration relies on **conda**, we need to tell TrackMate where is conda on your system.
There is a command to do this in the _Edit > Options >Configure TrackMate Conda path..._

You must find the actual executable of conda or mamba or micromamba on your system, not the alias.
This is typically where you installed your conda distribution, plus something like `condabin` or `bin`. 
To find it on my system where I installed mamba I typed `which mamba` in a terminal:
```sh
> which mamba
/Users/tinevez/mambaforge/bin/mamba
```
I then browsed to this path in the configuration window then clicked the `OK` button.

### Activate the TrackMate-Trackastra update site

In Fiji, go to {% include bc path='Help|Update...' %}. 
Update and restart Fiji until it is up-to-date. 
Then go to the update menu once more, and click on the `Manage update sites` button, at the bottom-left of the updater window. 
A new window containing all the known update sites will appear. 
Add the unlisted site  **TrackMate-Trackastra**, filling the information as follow:

{% include img src="/media/plugins/trackmate/trackers/trackastra/trackmate-trackastra-02" align='center' width='600' %}

Then restart Fiji once more. 

## Tracking _E. coli_ growth with Trackastra

We will use the same dataset that for the tutorial in the Trackastra code repository. 
Please download the archive below:

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.12600359.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12600359)

Open the TIF image in Fiji. 
It is a 2-channel movie of 20 frame. 
The first channel contains the segmentation results stored as a label image, and the second channel contines the source image. 
This movie follows the growth of two bacteria (_Escherichia coli_). 
While the bacteria divides, they move, probably because of sample or stage drift.

{% include img src="/media/plugins/trackmate/trackers/trackastra/trackmate-trackastra-04" align='center' width='400' %}

Launch TrackMate with this image selected (_Plugins > Tracking > TrackMate_), and in the detector selection. pick **Label image detector**.
Click the _Next_ button.
In the detector configuration pannel, make sure the channel 1 is selected (the labels are in the first channel), and click the _Next_ button again.
TrackMate should tell you that it found 128 spots. 

Go through the next panel, making sure you do not filter out any spots. 
When in the tracker selection step, pick **Trackastra**.
This panel should then be displayed:

{% include img src="/media/plugins/trackmate/trackers/trackastra/trackmate-trackastra-05" width='300' %}
{% include img src="/media/plugins/trackmate/trackers/trackastra/trackmate-trackastra-06" width='300' %}

We don't have to change much. 
The first item lets you select a conda environment among the list of those TrackMate discovered.
Of course, you need to select in what conda environment is your instalation of Trackastra.
In my case, I simply named this environment `trackastra`, which is selected in the first item of the configuration panel.
Trackstra requires the source image for tracking, so we have to tell it in what channel of our multi-channel image the raw input is.
In our case it is the channel 2. 
The `general_2d` pretrained model will work on this data, and since we want to detect cell divisions, we can simpy pick the `greedy` tracking mode. 

Click _Next_. 
Afer a while you should see the following log:

{% include img src="/media/plugins/trackmate/trackers/trackastra/trackmate-trackastra-07" align='center' %}

Et voila !
