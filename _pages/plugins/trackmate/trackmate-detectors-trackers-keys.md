# Setting keys for TrackMate detectors and trackers.

The detectors and trackers in TrackMate are configured via a set of key and values. In the GUI, TrackMate takes care of presenting to the user only the settings relevant to the chosen detector or tracker, but in scripts or other program, they must be known. This document lists all the parameters of all the current known detectors and trackers in TrackMate and shows how to configure them in your scripts and programs.

## Configuring a detector and a tracker.

First a word of how to specify what detector / tracker to use, and how to configure them programmatically. 

In TrackMate, all the parameters of a tracking are specified in a `Settings` object. This object contains everything, from the source image itself to the filters on tracks. It is made so that when properly set, you can get the final results of tracking and filtering with the following lines:

```python
# imp is the source ImagePlus.
settings = Settings( imp )

# configure settings now...
settings.xyz = abc # etc see below

# Create a TrackMate instance on these settings and run it.
trackmate = TrackMate( settings )
if not trackmate.checkInput():
  print( trackmate.getErrorMessage() )
else:
  if not trackmate.process():
    print( trackmate.getErrorMessage() )
print( 'Done.' )
```

We restrict ourselves here in showing how to configure the detector and tracker in the `Settings` object.

### The detector factory.

The detector to use is determined by setting the field `Settings.detectorFactory`. The value to enter must be a `SpotDetectorFactoryBase`. For instance like this (in Python):

```python
settings.detectorFactory = LogDetectorFactory()
```

As of today (February 2022), the following spot detectors are known:

#### Built-in detectors.

They are all found in the `fiji.plugin.trackmate.detection` package.

1. `LogDetectorFactory`
2. `DogDetectorFactory` 
3. `MaskDetectorFactory`
4. `ThresholdDetectorFactory`
5. `LabeImageDetectorFactory`
6. `ManualDetectorFactory`

#### Detectors in extensions.

7. `CellposeDetectorFactory`, in the `fiji.plugin.trackmate.cellpose` package, requires the `TrackMate-Cellpose` extension.
8. `IlastikDetectorFactory`, in the `fiji.plugin.trackmate.ilastik` package, requires the `TrackMate-Ilastik` extension.
8. `MorphoLibJDetectorFactory`, in the `fiji.plugin.trackmate.morpholibj` package, requires the `TrackMate-MorphoLibJ` extension.
9. `StarDistDetectorFactory`, in the `fiji.plugin.trackmate.stardist` package, requires the `TrackMate-StarDist` extension.
10. `StarDistCustomDetectorFactory`, as above.
11. `WekaDetectorFactory`, in the `fiji.plugin.trackmate.weka` package, requires the `TrackMate-Weka` extension.

### The tracker factory.

The tracker to use is determined by setting the field `Settings.trackerFactory`. The value to enter must be a `SpotTrackerFactory`. For instance like this (in Python):

```python
settings.trackerFactory = SimpleSparseLAPTrackerFactory()
```

As of today (February 2022), the following spot trackers are known:

1. `SimpleSparseLAPTrackerFactory` in the `fiji.plugin.trackmate.tracking.sparselap` package.
2. `SparseLAPTrackerFactory` in the same package.
3. `KalmanTrackerFactory` in the `fiji.plugin.trackmate.tracking.kalman` package.
4. `OverlapTrackerFactory` in the `fiji.plugin.trackmate.tracking.overlap` package.
5. `NearestNeighborTrackerFactory` in the `fiji.plugin.trackmate.tracking.kdtree` package.
6. `ManualTrackerFactory` in the `fiji.plugin.trackmate.tracking` package.

### The settings map or dict.

Once you picked a detector factory and a tracker factory, you must input their settings using a `Map<String Object>` in Java, or a `dict` in Python.  In what follows we suppose we are using a Python script to run TrackMate and will use the syntax of its language.

So, the settings for a detector or a tracker factory are given by a collection of key / value pairs, where the keys are all strings, and the values can be `int` ,`float`, `boolean` or more rarely other objects. They must be stored in a field called `detectorSettings` for the detector and in a field called `trackerSettings ` for the tracker. For instance, an example settings for the `LoGDetectorFactory` would be the following:

```python
settings.detectorFactory = LogDetectorFactory()
settings.detectorSettings = {
    'DO_SUBPIXEL_LOCALIZATION' : True,
    'RADIUS' : 2.5,
    'TARGET_CHANNEL' : 1,
    'THRESHOLD' : 0.,
    'DO_MEDIAN_FILTERING' : False,
}
```

We need to know for each detector and tracker exactly what are the keys they support and what is the type of values they expect. This is the goal of this document.

## Key / value definition for the detectors.

### LoG and DoG detector (`LogDetectorFactory` and `DogDetectorFactory`).

These two detectors use a different implementation but relies on the same key / valeus for their settings

## Key / value definition for the trackers.

### The simple LAP tracker (`SimpleSparseLAPTrackerFactory`).

This stripped-down implementation of the LAP tracker from *Jaqaman et al, 2008* has many parameters that are described in the next paragraph. For the purpose of this simplified version, it is best to start from the default settings returned by:

```py
settings = fiji.plugin.trackmate.tracking.LAPUtils.getDefaultLAPSettingsMap()
```

and edit the 3 following important parameters:

| Key                        | Value Type       | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `LINKING_MAX_DISTANCE`     | positive `float` | The max distance between two consecutive spots, in physical units, allowed for creating links. |
| `MAX_FRAME_GAP`            | positive `int`   | Gap-closing time-distance. The max difference in time-points between two spots to allow for linking. For instance a value of `2` means that the tracker will be able to make a link between a spot in frame `t ` and a successor spots in frame `t+2`, effectively bridging over one missed detection in one frame. |
| `GAP_CLOSING_MAX_DISTANCE` | positive `float` | Gap-closing max spatial distance. The max distance between two spots, in physical units, allowed for creating links over missing detections. |

### The LAP tracker (`SparseLAPTrackerFactory`).

This tracker is fully configurable with many parameters and feature weights.  All parameters are described in the table below. However for practical usage it is best  to start from the default settings returned by:

```py
settings = fiji.plugin.trackmate.tracking.LAPUtils.getDefaultLAPSettingsMap()
```

and edit the parameters that needs to change. For details on their meaning, please refer to the [TrackMate documentation](https://imagej.net/plugins/trackmate/algorithms#lap-trackers) and  *Jaqaman et al, 2008*.

| `MERGING_MAX_DISTANCE`            | positive `float`                    | Track merging max spatial distance. The max distance between one tracklet end one tracklet beginning, in physical units, allowed for creating links leading to track merges. |

| `ALLOW_TRACK_SPLITTING`           | `boolean`                           | If `True` then the tracker will perform tracklets or segments splitting, that is: have one tracklet ending linking to two or more tracklet beginnings . This leads to tracks possibly separating into several sub-tracks across time, like in cell division. |
| `SPLITTING_MAX_DISTANCE`          | positive `float`                    | Track splitting max spatial distance. The max distance between one tracklet end one tracklet beginning, in physical units, allowed for creating links leading to track splits. |

#### The feature penalty map.

Feature penalties are a way to alter individual linking cost by using the numerical features computed for all spots. We repeat here how individual costs they are calculated for this tracker.

The user is asked for a maximal allowed linking distance (entered in physical units, via *e.g.* the `LINKING_MAX_DISTANCE` parameter), and for a series of spot features, alongside with penalty weights. These parameters are used to tune the cost matrices. For two spots that may link, the linking cost is calculated as follow:

1. The distance between the two spots D is calculated

2. If the spots are separated by more than the max allowed distance, the link is forbidden, and the cost is set to infinity. If not,

3. For each feature in the map, a penalty p is calculated as

   ​		`p = 3 × W × |f1−f2| / ( f1+f2 )`

   where `W` is the weight associated to the feature in the map. This expression is such that:

   - there is no penalty if the 2 feature values `f1` and `f2` are the same;
   - with a weight of 1, the penalty is 1 if one feature value is the double of the other;
   - the penalty is 2 if one feature is 5 times the other one.

4. All penalties are summed, to form `P = (1 + ∑ p )`

5. The cost is set to the square of the product: `C = ( D × P )²`

If the user feeds no penalty, the costs are simply the distances squared.

The penalties are specified via a dictionary that maps the feature key to the weight `W` for this feature. For instance to specify a feature penalty for the frame-to-frame linking step on the spot radius with a weight of 2 and on the mean intensity in channel 1 with a weight of 5, create the following dict:

```python
penalty = {
    'RADIUS' : 2.,
    'MEAN_INTENSITY_CH1' : 5.
}
```

and use it as the value of the `LINKING_FEATURE_PENALTIES` key. This will penalize linking spots that have very different radii and small difference in the mean intensity.

You must use the **keys** of the features, not their name. Here is the table of the feature keys and names for the spot features:

| Spot feature key                                    | Spot feature name                                   |

### The Kalman tracker (`KalmanTrackerFactory`).

| Key                    | Value Type       | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `LINKING_MAX_DISTANCE` | positive `float` | The initial search radius, in physical units, specifying how far two spots can be apart when initiating new tracks. |
| `KALMAN_SEARCH_RADIUS` | positive `float` | The max search radius specifying how far from a predicted position the tracker should look  for candidate spots. |
| `MAX_FRAME_GAP`        | positive `int`   | The max difference in time-points between two spots to allow for linking. For instance a value of `2` means that the tracker will be able to make a link between a spot in frame `t ` and a successor spots in frame `t+2`, effectively bridging over one missed detection in one frame. |

### The overlap tracker (`OverlapTrackerFactory`).

| Key               | Value Type                           | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `SCALE_FACTOR`    | positive `float`                     | Scale factor:  enlarging (&gt;1) or shrinking (&lt;1) the spot shapes before computing their intersection over union (IoU). |
| `MIN_IOU`         | positive `float`                     | Minimal IoU below which links are not created.               |
| `IOU_CALCULATION` | `string`, either `FAST` or `PRECISE` | What method to use for IoU calculation.                      |

### The nearest-neighbor tracker (`NearestNeighborTrackerFactory`).

| Key                    | Value Type       | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `LINKING_MAX_DISTANCE` | positive `float` | The max distance, in physical units, specifying how far two spots can be apart to be linked. |

### The manual tracker (`ManualTrackerFactory`)

Using this tracker will result in the automatic tracking step to be skipped. It has no parameter.
