# TrackMate-Ilastik.

This page describes a detector module for [TrackMate](/plugins/trackmate/index) that relies on [Ilastik](https://www.ilastik.org/) to segment objects in 2D or 3D. It is not included in the core of TrackMate and must be installed via its own [update site](/update-sites/following).

## Installation.

For this module to work, you need three things:

1. Download and Install Ilastik on your machine. Follow the instructions on [this page](https://www.ilastik.org/download.html).
2. Subscribe to the **ilastik** [update site](/update-sites/following).

3. And finally, subscribe to the **TrackMate-Ilastik** update site.

We rely on the capabilities of the **ilastik Fiji import/export plugin**, built by the ilastik team. It is documented in detail [in the ilastik website](https://www.ilastik.org/documentation/fiji_export/plugin).
