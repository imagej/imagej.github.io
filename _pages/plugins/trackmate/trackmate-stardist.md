# TrackMate-StarDist

This page describes a detector module for [TrackMate](/plugins/trackmate/index) that relies on [StarDist](/plugins/stardist) to segment objects in 2D. It is not included in the core of TrackMate and must be installed via its own [update site](/update-sites/following).

## Installation.

You need to subscribe to the **CSBDeep** update site and to the **StarDist** update site first, then to the **TrackMate-StarDist** update site:

The CSBDeep update site:

And finally the TrackMate-StarDist update site.
![Subscribe to the TrackMate-StarDist update site](/media/plugins/trackmate/trackmate-stardist-install.png)

Once you have them all, please restart Fiji.
We suggest that you test StarDist by itself just to make sure it runs after installation. This way we can better find what is wrong in case it does not work. Follow for instance the instructions on the [StarDist](/plugins/stardist) page.

## Usage and tutorial.

TrackMate-StarDist ships two detectors that will appear in TrackMate. After installing TrackMate-StarDist and restarting Fiji, these two detectors will be integrated in TrackMate in a transparent manner. We describe how to use them in the four tutorial below.
They describe in order:
1. Using TrackMate-StarDist on a single-channel image.
2. Using TrackMate-StarDist on a multi-channel image and exploiting the intensity information.
3. Using TrackMate-StarDist with a custom Deep-Learning model.
4. Using TrackMate-StarDist to segment a 3D image using a slice-by-slice approach.

### StarDist detector with builtin versatile nuclei model on a single channel image.

The StarDist plugin comes with a very efficient model that can segment nuclei imaged in fluorescence in 2D, generated from the dataset in the Kaggle challenge of 2018:

{% include citation doi='10.1038/s41592-019-0612-7'%}

We use this model in the first StarDist detector. 

In the first tutorial we will use a movie following the migration of cancer cells, labelled for their nuclei. 
You can download it from Zenodo:

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5206107.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5206107)


First launch Fiji and open the tutorial image in Fiji.
We use here the `P31-crop.tif` file, provided in the tutorial data.

{% include img name="Cell images" src="/media/plugins/trackmate/trackmate-stardist-builtin-detector-image.png" align="center" %}

Then launch TrackMate {% include bc path='Plugins>Tracking>TrackMate' %}.
In the second panel titled **Select a detector**, you should see two new choices in the list, and on of them is **StarDist detector**. 
{% include img name="TrackMate-StarDist builtin detector choice" src="/media/plugins/trackmate/trackmate-stardist-select-builtin-detector.png" align="center" %}

Select it and click **Next**.



This simple panel appears. 
{% include img name="TrackMate-StarDist builtin detector config" src="/media/plugins/trackmate/trackmate-stardist-builtin-detector-config-panel.png" %}

*Note that in this panel there is no configuration for Stardist detector: we use the default values of this model for the score threshold and overlap threshold. We observed, that in cases when this model with the default values does not work well with some dataset, changing the score and overlap threshold have little to no positive impact on the results. We reasoned therefore that if the model and the default values do not work well for your data, it is best then to train a specific StarDist model for your problem.*

Check the results of segmentation by clicking on the **Preview** button.
Here is what I get on the first time-point of the tutorial image:
{% include img name="TrackMate-StarDist results" src="/media/plugins/trackmate/trackmate-stardist-preview-results.png" align="center" %}

The StarDist model works really well with this kind of data.
After that you follow through the next steps in TrackMate to segment all cells in all time-points then track them. 
Using the default tracker and default parameters each time we get this result:

{% include video src="/media/plugins/trackmate/trackmate-stardist-results.mp4" width=800 align="center" %}

It was simple and fast, which means that careful inspection for missed cell divisions and false links is on order.


### ERK signalling and motility assay with a multi-channel image.

In this part of the tutorial we will correlate the translocation of an ERK reported in the nuclei with cell motility. We will use images from a cell migration assay, where cells are expressing an ERK reported in the first channel, and are stained for their nuclei in the second channel. The analysis will consist in segmenting and tracking the cells in the nuclei channel and analyzing intensities in the ERK channel. In a second part we will investigate whether the instantaneous speed correlates with the ERK signal in the nuclei.

You can find the source image and additional files on Zenodo:

#### Tracking with TrackMate.

Step by step:

- Open Fiji.
- Open your image. This image has two channels, the ERK reporter in channel 1 (green) and a DNA staining in channel 2 (grey).
- Open TrackMate {% include bc path='Plugins>Tracking>TrackMate' %}. The TrackMate start panel will open, showing information about the image dimensions. Click `Next`.
- The “Select a detector” panel opens. From the pull-down menu, select the `StarDist detector`. The description of the detector method will appear in the panel. Click `Next`.

{% include img  src="/media/plugins/trackmate/trackmate-stardist-erk-tutorial-1.png" width='300' align="center" %}

- A panel with a description of the StarDist detector opens. By clicking on the `Segment in channel` slider, select the channel to segment. Here, select channel 2, which contains the DNA label.
- By clicking the `Preview` button, you can test the detector on the current frame. 
- When you are happy with the result, click `Next`.
- The detector will detect all nuclei in the selected channel for all time frames. As the movie has many time-points, this can take a few minutes.
- When the progress bar has reached the end, click `Next`.
- A panel to filter the detected spots according to their quality opens (more information about this filtering can be found here). In this exercise, this part can be ignored. Please click `Next`.

{% include img  src="/media/plugins/trackmate/trackmate-stardist-erk-tutorial-2.png" width='300' align="center" %}

- A panel to filter spots according to their properties (i.e. size, shape, location, or signal intensity) opens. In this exercise, do the following:
  - Click the green plus sign at the bottom of the panel - a filter appears.
  - Click the pull-down menu and select `Area`. Here we will filter out the smallest detected objects. Make sure the `Above` button is selected.
  - Drag the horizontal line (pink dashed line) to value 30.92 (approximatively). If you want to enter an exact value as threshold, just click inside the filter panel to make it active (the text becomes red) and type the number you want with key board. After 1 second it will be set as threshold.
  - Click again on the green plus sign at the bottom of the panel to activate a second filter.
  - Click the pull-down menu and select `Mean intensity ch2`. Here we will filter out the detected objects with low intensity in Channel 2. Make sure the `Above` button is selected. Drag the horizontal line (pink dashed line) to value 120.73. Click `Next`.

{% include img  src="/media/plugins/trackmate/trackmate-stardist-erk-tutorial-3.png" width='300' align="center" %}

- Next, a tracking panel opens. In this panel, you can select the methods for tracking objects. Here, we use the `LAP tracker` to account for possibly dividing cells. Please select it from the pull-down menu, and click `Next`.
- A panel for the LAP tracker settings opens. Int this panel, you choose how to track the cells. First, with the `Frame to Frame linking` parameter, you give the maximum distance to link two objects between frames. Here use 30 microns. Then, you can choose how many spots can be missing, and they could still be the same track. Tick the `Allow gap closing` box and add values: `Max distance`: 30 microns and `Max frame gap`: 5. Next, you let TrackMate know if the tracks are allowed to split. Splitting can be caused, for example, due to cell division. Tick the box `Allow track segment splitting` and insert value `Max distance`: 15 microns. Below you will also see settings for `Track segment merging`. Here this box should remain unticked. Click `Next`.

{% include img  src="/media/plugins/trackmate/trackmate-stardist-erk-tutorial-4.png" width='250' align="center" %}

- After tracking, a track filter panel opens. In this panel, you can remove tracks according to their properties (i.e., length, speed, or location).
Here, we filter out short tracks to remove cells that migrate in or out of the field of view. As for the object filtering step described above, click the green plus sign to add a filter. Next, click on the pull-down menu and select `Track duration` from the list. Make sure that `Above` is ticked and set the slider to about 30k. Click `Next`.

{% include img  src="/media/plugins/trackmate/trackmate-stardist-erk-tutorial-5.png" width='300' align="center" %}

- A window with track visualization options opens. Here it is possible to edit track or object colours according to their properties. 
  - First, make sure that the `Display spots` and `as ROIs` boxes are ticked.
  - One option is to label the spots (nuclei) according to the standard deviation of channel 1 intensity. In this case, a blue colour will indicate that the ERK activity reporter signal is stable over time. In contrast, a red colour will show that the ERK activity reporter signal fluctuates over time. With this colouring, it is possible to visualise cells displaying ERK activity oscillations. 
  - To do this, select from the pulldown menu `Color spots by Mean intensity ch1`. Click `auto` below to spread out the signal colour.
  - For the tracks, we will visualize the track displacement. First, make sure you have the `Show tracks local in time` selected from the pull-down menu after `Display tracks`. 
  - Next, tick the `Fade tracks` in the time box and select a `Fade range` of 14. Next, choose from the pull-down menu: `Color tracks by Track displacement`. This will show the tracks that move a short distance in blue and the longest travelled track in red. Now you can visualise if the presence of ERK oscillation corresponds to the distance travelled by the cells.
- In this panel, you can also export the results as .CSV files. Please do so, we will need them for the analysis in MATLAB in the seconfd paty. Click on the `Tracks` button at the bottom of the panel. A window with a lot of data shows up. Ensure you export the `Spots` (information about the spot) and the `Edges`  (information about the links between 2 spots) files. Close the results window and click `Next`.

{% include img  src="/media/plugins/trackmate/trackmate-stardist-erk-tutorial-6.png" width='300' align="center" %}

- In the next panel  `Plot features`, it is possible to Plot some of the features of the tracks, for example, the changes of the signal intensity over time. However we cannot readily correlates the instantanous speed with the ERK intensity in nuclei, because the former is a feature of edge objects and the latter of spot objects. We will address this in a second part with a MATLAB analysis script. Click `Next`.
- In the next panel, there is a possibility to do different actions. For this exercise, we will export a tracking image of our experiment. From the pull-down menu, please select `Capture overlay`. As you click on `Execute` below, a pop-up window opens. Here you can define the time interval you want to save. Please tick the box `Hide image` and click `OK`.
TrackMate will generate a video of the experiment.

#### Track analysis with MATLAB.

The zip file of the dataset contains the 2 CSV files generated from the first paty above, and a MATLAB script that reads them and investigate whether the speed correlates with ERK intensity.
We outline the script here.

First let's load the data.

```matlab
clear
close 
clc

% Path to the CSV files, exported from TrackMate.
spots_csv_file = 'CellMigration_WithERK-spots.csv';
edges_csv_file = 'CellMigration_WithERK-edges.csv';

%% Load CSV files into MATLAB tables.
spot_table = readtable( spots_csv_file );
edge_table = readtable( edges_csv_file );


%% Display info on tables.

fprintf( 'Header of the spot table:\n' )
head( spot_table )

fprintf( '\nHeader of the edge table:\n' )

As said above, we need to correlate a value that belongs in two different tables: the mean ERK intensity in the spot table, and the speed in the edge table.
The speed is defined as an edge feature, because you need two spots to define a displacement and a time interval, hence a speed.
But we want to plot the speed and intensity for the same spot. 
The trick is to use the spot `ID` value, which is unique in a tracking session.
The edge table has two columns that store the ID of the 2 spots it links: `SPOT_SOURCE_ID` and `SPOT_TARGET_ID`.
So we need to join the 2 tables, using the `ID` column in the spot table and (for instance) the `SPOT_TARGET_ID` in the edge table. 
In MATLAB, this is done as follow:

```matlab
T = join( edge_table, spot_table, ...
    'LeftKeys', 'SPOT_TARGET_ID', 'RightKeys', 'ID', ...
    'LeftVariables','SPEED' , 'RightVariables', 'MEAN_INTENSITY_CH1');
head(T)
```

```
ans =

  8×2 table

      SPEED      MEAN_INTENSITY_CH1

     0.030591          1063.9      
```

 And finally we can visualize whether we have some correlation with a  scatter plot.

```matlab
figure
scatter( T.SPEED, T.MEAN_INTENSITY_CH1, 'k.' )
xlabel( 'Speed (µm/sec)' )
ylabel( 'ERK nuclei intensity' )
```

{% include img  src="/media/plugins/trackmate/CellMigration_WithERK_01.png" width='400' align="center" %}

It's rather unclear with that many points. Let's try to plot the density of points.

```matlab
figure
histogram2( T.SPEED, T.MEAN_INTENSITY_CH1, 'FaceColor', 'flat' )
view( 2 )
grid off
box off
xlabel( 'Speed (µm/sec)' )
ylabel( 'ERK nuclei intensity' )
```

{% include img  src="/media/plugins/trackmate/CellMigration_WithERK_02.png" width='400' align="center" %}

It's not more clearer. Let's analyze the correlation coefficient.

```matlab
[ R, P ] = corrcoef( T.SPEED, T.MEAN_INTENSITY_CH1 );

fprintf( 'Correlation coefficient: %.2e\n', R( 1, 2 ) )
fprintf( 'P-value for the correlation: %.2f\n', P( 1, 2 ) )
```

```
Correlation coefficient: 4.00e-03
P-value for the correlation: 0.56
```

 We have to conclude that this dataset does not show a correlation between  instantaneous speed and ERK intensity in the nucleus.
Maybe we need to filter out some spots with low speed, or investigate tracks as a whole.
But this is left as an exercise to the reader.



### Tracking T-cells imaged in bright-field with a custom model in the StarDist detector.

You can also use a custom model, that you have trained yourself and packaged as a zip file.
We recommend using the dedicated notebooks on the _ZeroCostDL4Mic_ platform to do so. Check the [ZCDL4M wiki page dedicated to training StarDist](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/ZeroCostDL4Mic/wiki/Stardist) to generate such a model.

In this tutorial we will track T cells imaged in bright-field with a model we trained ourselves. 
You can find the image and the model (packaged as a zip file) on Zenodo:

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5206119.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5206119)

First open the tutorial image called `TCellsMigration.tif` in Fiji  provided in the tutorial data.

{% include img name="T cells" src="/media/plugins/trackmate/trackmate-stardist-custom-detector-2-image.png" width="800" align="center" %}

Launch TrackMate. In the second panel titled **Select a detector**, choose **StarDist detector custom model** and click **Next**. Its configuration panel requires several parameters:

{% include img name="Custom detector" src="/media/plugins/trackmate/trackmate-stardist-select-custom-detector2.png" width="800" align="center" %}

- In the **Custom model file** text field, you need to enter the path to a StarDist model packaged as a zip file (or use the **Browse** button to navigate to the folder). In the tutorial dataset the file is called `StarDistModel-TCellsBF.zip`.
- **Score threshold** correspond to the threshold on the probability map to identify object. It accepts values from 0 to 1.
- **Overlap threshold** correspond to the threshold used in non-maxima suppression step used to separate touching/overlapping objects; it accepts values from 0 to 1.

- Set these parameters and click **Preview** button to test the detector on the current frame. Here is an example of what we get on the first time-point of the tutorial image (using default parameters): 

  {% include img name="Preview result" src="/media/plugins/trackmate/trackmate-stardist-custom-detector-2-preview.png" width="800" align="center" %}

- In case the results are satisfying, click **Next** to perform detection in the full time-series. After the detection is finished, continue with the following steps same as in standard TrackMate [workflow](https://imagej.net/plugins/trackmate/getting-started#the-detection-process). Using the default tracker (Simple LAP tracker) with the default parameters we get this result:

### Generation of 3D labels by tracking 2D labels using TrackMate.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to generate 3D labels using TrackMate.
The segmentation of 3D objects can be very hard. 
Deep-Learning proves to be very efficient but there are still many models and algorithms that only work for the 2D case.
In this tutorial, we "hack" TrackMate to segment 3D objects using the 2D StarDist segmentation algorithm.
We trick TrackMate into thinking a 3D image is a 2D movie over time. 
We track the fake 2D objects in Z, and use the resulting track information to rebuild the 3D segmentation of objects.
The following step-by-step tutorial shows how to do this.

First download the dataset from Zenodo:

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5220610.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5220610)

The dataset onctains the raw data but also the intermediate label images in case you want to play with them directly. 

- Open Fiji.
- Open the `Spheroid-3D.tif` image in Fiji. This image is a Z stack of MCF10DCIS.com 3D spheroids that have been stained with DAPI to visualise their nuclei.
- Open TrackMate  {% include bc path='Plugins>Tracking>TrackMate' %}. As the image is a 3D Z stack, TrackMate will ask you to swap the Z and T dimensions. This is what we want; click `Yes`.

{% include img  src="/media/plugins/trackmate/trackmate-stardist-spheroid-tutorial-1.png" width='300' align="center" %}

- The start panel will open, showing information about the image dimensions. Click `Next`.
- The `Select a detector` panel opens. From the pull-down menu select the `StarDist detector`. Click `Next`.
- A panel with a description of the StarDist detector opens.  By clicking the `Preview` button, you can test the StarDist detector on the current frame. When you are happy with the result, click `Next`.

{% include img  src="/media/plugins/trackmate/trackmate-stardist-spheroid-tutorial-2.png" width='200' %}
{% include img  src="/media/plugins/trackmate/trackmate-stardist-spheroid-tutorial-3.png" width='350' %}

- The detector will detect all nuclei in the selected channel for all time frames. This can take a few minutes.
- When the progress bar has reached the end, click `Next`.
- A panel to filter the detected spots according to their quality opens (more information about this filtering can be found [here](https://imagej.net/plugins/trackmate/getting-started#initial-spot-filtering)). In this exercise, this part can be ignored. Click `Next`.

- A panel to filter spots according to their properties (i.e. size, shape, location, or signal intensity) opens. In this exercise, do the following:
  - Click on the green plus sign at the bottom of the panel - a filter appears at the top of the panel.
  - Click on the pull-down menu and select `Area`. Here we will filter out the smallest detected objects. Make sure the `Above` button is selected.
  - Drag the horizontal line (cyan dashed line) to value 31.47.
  - Click on the green plus sign at the bottom of the panel again - a new filter appears.
  - Click on the pull-down menu and select `Max intensity ch1`. Here we will filter out the objects that have low intensity. Make sure the `Above` button is selected. Drag the horizontal line (cyan dashed line) to value 45524.62.
  - Click on `Next`.

{% include img  src="/media/plugins/trackmate/trackmate-stardist-spheroid-tutorial-4.png" width='300' align="center" %}

- Next, a tracking panel opens. In this panel, you can select the methods for tracking objects. Here, we use the `LAP tracker`. Please select it from the pull-down menu, and click `Next`.
- A panel to choose the LAP tracker settings opens. With this panel, you choose how to track the cells. First, with the `Frame to Frame linking` parameter, you give the maximum distance to link two objects between frames. Here use 4 microns. Next, you tell Trackmate how many spots can be missing and still be the same track. Tick the `Allow gap closing` box and add values: `Max distance`: 4 microns and `Max frame gap`: 3. Click `Next`.

{% include img  src="/media/plugins/trackmate/trackmate-stardist-spheroid-tutorial-5.png" width='300' align="center" %}

- A Track filter panel opens. In this panel, you can remove tracks according to their properties (i.e., length, speed, or location). Here, we filter out the shortest tracks to remove possible artefacts. Similarly, as in the object filtering above, click the green plus sign to add a filter. Click the pull-down menu and select `Track duration` from the list. Make sure that the `Above` option is ticked and set the slider to 3.45. Click `Next`.

{% include img  src="/media/plugins/trackmate/trackmate-stardist-spheroid-tutorial-6.png" width='300' align="center" %}

- A window with track visualization options opens. Here it is possible to edit track or object colours according to their properties. We don't need to use it in this exercise. Click on `Next`.
- Click on Next again.
- You should have reached the `Select an action` panel. In this panel, there is a possibility to do different actions. For this exercise, we will export a label image of the tracked objects. From the pull-down menu, select `Export label image` and click on `Execute`.
* From the pop-up window, tick the box `Export only spots in tracks` to eliminate any object not linked to a track and click `OK`.

{% include img  src="/media/plugins/trackmate/trackmate-stardist-spheroid-tutorial-7.png" width='400' align="center" %}

- The label image is now exported. Remember to change the dimensions back from T to Z in Fiji  {% include bc path='Image>Properties' %} and to save your image {% include bc path='File > Save as...' %}.
- The label image can be viewed in 3D for instance using [FPBioimage](https://fpb.ceb.cam.ac.uk/), and further analysed using the [3D ImageJ Suite](/plugins/3d-imagej-suite/).
