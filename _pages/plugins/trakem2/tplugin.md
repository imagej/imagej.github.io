## TPlugIn Implementation

Interface `ini.trakem2.plugin.TPlugIn` allows for TrakEM2 plugins to be called from either the Display menu or the Project Tree menu. Suppose that we would like to add a plugin in class `SomePlugIn`, named "Some PlugIn". `TPlugIn` specifies the following methods:

### public boolean setup(Object... params)

Called through {% include bc path="Plugins|Setup Some PlugIn" %}

params contains 1 null element when nothing is selected, or the first of any selected elements when the call is made. Return true for success.

### public Object invoke(Object... params)

Called through {% include bc path="Plugins|Some PlugIn" %}

Similar to setup. The returned `Object` appears not to be used.

### public boolean applies(Object ob)

Determines whether the menu item for the given `TPlugIn` is active.

Before the right-click menu is displayed, `TPlugIn.applies(Object)` is called for all registered `TPlugIn`s. `Object` ob is the currently selected `Object`, or `null` if there isn't one. If this method returns `true`, the menu item {% include bc path="Plugins|Some PlugIn" %} will be active. If it returns `false`, it will be inactive and grey.

## Registering With TrakEM2

To register a `TPlugIn` with TrakEM2, include a file `SomePlugIn.trakem2` in the jar file containing `SomePlugIn`, with the following format:
```
Display, "Some PlugIn", full.package.and.class.to.SomePlugIn
```
to add to the Display menu, or
```
Project Tree, "Some PlugIn", full.package.and.class.to.SomePlugIn
```
to add to the Project Tree menu. This file may contain multiple lines.
