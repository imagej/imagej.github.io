This plugin takes a sequence of image slices stored in a folder, and delivers a list of transformed image slices (with enlarged canvas) applying a list of transforms stored as **.XML** files in another folder.

This is a **complementary plugin** of [Register Virtual Stack Slices](/plugins/register-virtual-stack-slices). It allows reproducing the results of [Register Virtual Stack Slices](/plugins/register-virtual-stack-slices) by loading the corresponding transform files (saved by checking the option [ "Save transforms"](/plugins/register-virtual-stack-slices#save-transforms) in the main dialog).

## User Manual

**Premises**:

-   **Source folder**: You have a folder with an ordered list of image files in it that Fiji can open.
-   Each image represents a slice in a sequence.
-   **Output folder**: You have or create a folder to store the resulting virtual stack with the transformed images.
-   **Transform folder**: You have a folder with the transform files (from a [Register Virtual Stack Slices](/plugins/register-virtual-stack-slices) execution).
-   **Interpolate**: Toggle the interpolation for the result images.

**Step 1**: launch the "Plugins - Transform - Transform Virtual Stack Slices" plugin. {% include thumbnail src='/media/main-dialog-transform-virtual-stack.png' title='Transform Virtual Stack main dialog'%} **Step 2**: choose the source, output and transform folders:

-   Select a source folder containing the slices, at one slice per image file.
-   Select the target folder where resulting transformed slices will be automatically stored as TIFF files.
-   Select the transform folder, where the .XML files from a [Register Virtual Stack Slices](/plugins/register-virtual-stack-slices) are stored.

**Results**: on success, a virtual stack will open showing all the transformed images contained in the output folder. The virtual stack can be closed with no ill effect: images are saved in the output folder.
