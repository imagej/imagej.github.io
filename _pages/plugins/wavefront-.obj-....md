This plugin will threshold a stack and create a surface using marchingcubes, and then save that as a Wavefront .OBJ file.

There is an option to export surfaces in this format from the [3D Viewer](/plugins/3d-viewer) but this option may still be useful for you in the following situations:

-   If the 3D Viewer doesn't work for you (or is very slow)
-   If you are using Fiji's --headless option
