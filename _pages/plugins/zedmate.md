**ZedMate** is a suite of plugins aimed multi-channel intensity quantification.

The main plugin called **ZedMate** is aimed at particle detection and intensity quantification in 3D multi-channel images. The main detector is based on the TrackMate Laplacian of Gaussian engine. Most contemporary microscopy modalities are anisotropic in their XYZ-resolution. Specifically Z-resolution is inferior to XY. That's why it is convenient to think of particle detection in 3D as a 2D particle detection + tracking problem. ZedMate manuscript is currently in preparation
