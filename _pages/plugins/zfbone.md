ZFBONE is a FIJI-based toolset that provides tools needed for a rapid, reliable and semi-automatized morphometric analysis of zebrafish bone structures to identify compounds that have an effect on bone formation, mineralization or patterning in zebrafish. These tools are used to screen/study compounds with bone anabolic effects (osteoactives) and bone toxic effects (osteotoxicants).
