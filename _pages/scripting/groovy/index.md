## Introduction

[Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/) is an agile and dynamic language for the Java Virtual Machine. It builds upon the strengths of [Java](/develop/plugins) but has additional power features inspired by languages like [Python](/scripting/python), [Ruby](/scripting/jruby) and Smalltalk.

## Quickstart

-   Press {% include key key='[' %} to bring up the [Script Editor](/scripting/script-editor).
-   Select an example Groovy script from the {% include bc path='Templates | [by language] | Groovy'%} menu.
-   Press {% include key keys='Ctrl|R' %} to run the script!
