## What is the Javadoc?

The source code of java programs is "self-documented".

Most classes, methods and attributes are described by some short docstring to explain their purpose. This documentation can be visualised as a user-friendly webpage: the Javadoc or API (for Application Programming Interface).

The API is a precious resource for users and developers willing to develop custom scripts or programs. It lists all available functions for a given class, and give information on what type of parameter they expect and return.

Most [SciJava](/libs/scijava) project APIs can be found at:

{% include link-banner url="https://javadoc.scijava.org" %}

And more particularly for:

-   [ImageJ](https://javadoc.scijava.org/ImageJ1)
-   [ImageJ2](https://javadoc.scijava.org/ImageJ2)
-   [Fiji](https://javadoc.scijava.org/Fiji/)

## The original ImageJ API

The diagram below depicts the relation between the different classes composing the original [ImageJ](/software/imagej):
