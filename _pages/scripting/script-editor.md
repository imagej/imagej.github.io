Usage
-----

### Starting the editor

To get started, start up the script editor:

<img src="/media/Script-Editor-new.jpg" width="500"/>

There is also the keyboard shortcut {% include key content='\[' %} (open square bracket) to open the editor.

### Choosing a language

Then choose a language from the language menu:

![](/media/Script-Editor-choose-language.jpg"Script-Editor-choose-language.jpg")

Now you can write your script. In this tutorial, Jython was chosen as scripting language, but the process is really the same for all scripting languages.

![](/media/Script-Editor-first-script.jpg "Script-Editor-first-script.jpg")

### Running the script

Once you are satisfied with the script, run it. This does not require saving, but of course you should save your script later when it works.

![](/media/Script-Editor-run.jpg "Script-Editor-run.jpg")

Note that while the script is running, the window title shows the tell-tale *(Running)*.

You can use all of ImageJ's classes right away. Here is an example that shows a dialog where the user can input a number. For details how to write dialogs in the different scripting languages, see [Scripting comparisons](/scripting/comparisons)

![](/media/Script-Editor-dialog.jpg "Script-Editor-dialog.jpg")
