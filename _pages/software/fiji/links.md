## Image Processing

See the [Principles](/imaging/principles) page.

[A pixel is not a little square](http://alvyray.com/Memos/CG/Microsoft/6_pixel.pdf). Really. It is not. Pixels may be spaced on a regular grid. But that does not make them square. Even thinking about them as squares will harm your analysis, since it is simply wrong.

Explore the [Hypermedia Image Processing Reference](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/) of the Department of Artificial Intelligence in the University of Edinburgh for an extensive overview of available image processing techniques.

The University of Edinburgh also has the rather complete [CVonline](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CVonline/) compendium of Computer Vision.

## Programming in science

In research Software should be treated just like materials: if you publish your results, you should [publish the software (including source code)](http://sciencecodemanifesto.org/), too.

Even [Nature](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101013/full/467753a.html) says that your code is good enough; you should publish it if you want to be a good scientist.

If you're still unsure and think that your code is not good enough, then publish it under a license [appropriate for science](http://matt.might.net/articles/crapl/) (CRAPL).
