project-blurb: the original version of ImageJ
---

[ImageJ](/software/imagej) is [public domain](/licensing/public-domain) software for processing and analyzing scientific images, with many derivatives and variants, including [ImageJ2](/software/imagej2), [Fiji](/software/fiji), and [others](/learn/flavors).

The original ImageJ has been under continuous development since 1997. It has always been, and continues to be, a project of {% include person id='rasband' %}, with the help of many contributers. It was initially developed in 1997 as a cross-platform version of [NIH Image](/software/nih-image). ImageJ grew organically over time as {% include person id='rasband' %} continued to add features according to user requests. Now there are many hundreds, probably thousands, of plugins written by members of a diverse community.

This wiki refers to the original version of ImageJ as **the original ImageJ** or **ImageJ 1.x** in places where it is important to distinguish it from [other flavors of ImageJ](/learn/flavors). You may also sometimes see it called "plain ImageJ" or "ImageJ1" or "IJ1" by the community, but these are only shorthands.

The other main flavor of ImageJ, a redesign started in 2010, is known as [ImageJ2](/software/imagej2), to differentiate it from the original ImageJ. The [Fiji](/software/fiji) distribution of ImageJ bundles both ImageJ 1.x and ImageJ2, including ImageJ2's [backwards compatibility layer](/libs/imagej-legacy) to transparently convert between ImageJ 1.x and ImageJ2 data structures as needed.
