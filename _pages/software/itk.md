ITK integration with ImageJ
===========================

Although ITK is a C++ application, many ITK functions are available in ImageJ through the [SimpleITK](http://www.simpleitk.org/) Java compatibility layer.

Enabling this functionality in ImageJ is simply a matter of turning on the {% include list-of-update-sites content='ImageJ-ITK update site' %}. Note that this will trigger a large download, as it requires the SimpleITK native library (up to a few hundred MB).

What's on the update site?
--------------------------

SimpleITK 0.90 is distributed with this update. After update all SimpleITK classes can be called from the script editor.

When using `@itkImage` [parameters](Script_parameters) in scripts, ImageJ `Dataset` objects will be automatically converted to SimpleITK `Image` objects.

There are several templates in the [Script Editor](/scripting/script-editor) demonstrating ITK use. The following example shows how to perform Otsu multilevel threshold using SimpleITK.

    # @itkImage image
    # @OUTPUT Dataset output

    from org.itk.simple import OtsuMultipleThresholdsImageFilter

    otsu = OtsuMultipleThresholdsImageFilter()

    # call otsu using simple itk wrapper
    output = otsu.execute(image, 2, 0, 255, True)
