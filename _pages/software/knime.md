KNIME integrates various components for machine learning and data mining through its modular data pipelining concept. A graphical user interface allows assembly of nodes for data preprocessing (ETL: Extraction, Transformation, Loading), for modeling and data analysis and visualization.

The [**KN**IME **I**mage **P**rocessing](http://tech.knime.org/community/image-processing) extension, KNIP, provides ca. 100 nodes for (pre)-processing, filtering, segmentation, feature extraction, various views (2D, 3D), etc. and integrations for various other image processing tools are available.

As part of the KNIP extension, there is an [ImageJ extension for KNIME](http://tech.knime.org/community/imagej) consisting of two basic parts: the support for [ImageJ1](/software/imagej1) macro execution and the integration of [ImageJ2](/software/imagej2) plugins as KNIME nodes. Both approaches are available as KNIME plugin (currently beta status).
