The [KNIME Analytics Platform](https://www.knime.com/) is an open source data analytics, reporting and integration platform and application. KNIME integrates various components for machine learning and data mining through its modular data pipelining concept. A graphical user interface allows assembly of nodes for data preprocessing (ETL: Extraction, Transformation, Loading), for modeling and data analysis and visualization. KNIME is an acronym for **K**o**n**stanz **I**nformation **M**in**e**r.

The [KNIME Image Processing](https://www.knime.com/community/image-processing) extension, nicknamed KNIP, provides ca. 100 nodes for (pre)-processing, filtering, segmentation, feature extraction, various views (2D, 3D), etc. and integrations for various other image processing tools are available. As part of KNIP, there is an [ImageJ extension for KNIME](https://www.knime.com/community/imagej) consisting of two basic parts: the support for [ImageJ](/software/imagej) macro execution, and the integration of [ImageJ2](/software/imagej2) plugins as KNIME nodes. Both approaches are available as KNIME plugins (currently beta status).
