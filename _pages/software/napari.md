[napari](https://napari.org/) is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image
viewer for Python. It’s designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large
multi-dimensional images. It’s built on top of `Qt` (for the GUI), `vispy` (for
performant GPU-based rendering), and the scientific Python stack (`numpy`,
`scipy`). It includes critical viewer features out-of-the-box, such as support
for large multi-dimensional data, and layering and annotation. By integrating
closely with the Python ecosystem, napari can be easily coupled to leading
machine learning and image analysis tools (e.g. `scikit-image`, `scikit-learn`,
`TensorFlow`, `PyTorch`), enabling more user-friendly automated analysis.

A plugin called [napari-imagej](https://github.com/imagej/napari-imagej) is
currently being developed to enable use of [ImageJ2](/software/imagej2)
commands from the napari interface. Like other ImageJ2 Python integrations
(e.g. [CellProfiler](/software/cellprofiler)), the napari-imagej plugin is
built on [PyImageJ](https://pypi.org/project/pyimagej).
