[OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) is a widespread computer vision and machine learning library applied in a great variety of contexts, including life sciences. The power of OpenCV relies on the huge amount (more than 2500) of both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms provided by this library. OpenCV supplies algorithms for: image processing, feature detection, object detection, machine-learning, and video analysis.

Currently, the following alternatives allow to connect ImageJ/Fiji with OpenCV:

-   [CVForge](https://github.com/m4dguy/CVForge): an ImageJ plugin implementing a simple-to-use interface that gives access to all the methods of OpenCV.

<!-- -->

-   [IJ-OpenCV](/plugins/ij-opencv): a library to convert between ImageJ1 and OpenCV objects. It provides methods to convert images, ROI...  

From the perspective of ImageJ developers, they can use IJ-OpenCV to easily create plugins that use any functionality provided by the OpenCV library and explore different alternatives.  
From the perspective of OpenCV developers, this library provides a link to the ImageJ graphical user interface and all its features to handle regions of interest.

-   [ImageJ-OpenCV](https://github.com/imagej/imagej-opencv) is similar to IJ-OpenCV but provides converters between OpenCV and ImageJ2 types.

<!-- -->

-   [IJToolsUsingOpenCV](https://github.com/WAKU-TAKE-A/IJToolsUsingOpenCV): a suite of ImageJ plugins that connects ImageJ with some of the algorithms implemented in OpenCV.
