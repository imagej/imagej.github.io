[OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) is a widespread computer vision and machine learning library applied in a great variety of contexts, including life sciences. The power of OpenCV relies on the huge amount (more than 2500) of both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms provided by this library. OpenCV supplies algorithms for: image processing, feature detection, object detection, machine-learning, and video analysis.

Currently, the following alternatives exist to connect [ImageJ](/software/imagej) and/or [ImageJ2](/software/imagej2) with OpenCV:

-   [PyImageJ](https://github.com/imagej/pyimagej): a Python wrapper for [ImageJ2](/software/imagej2) enabling access to all of ImageJ2 and the [original ImageJ](/software/imagej) from Python. Together with [opencv-python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/), the two programs can be used together with [NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) arrays as a common data structure.

-   [CVForge](https://github.com/m4dguy/CVForge): an ImageJ plugin implementing a simple-to-use interface that gives access to all the methods of OpenCV.

-   [IJ-OpenCV](/libs/ij-opencv): a library to convert between [original ImageJ](/software/imagej) data structures and OpenCV objects.

-   [ImageJ-OpenCV](https://github.com/imagej/imagej-opencv) is similar to IJ-OpenCV but provides converters between OpenCV and [ImageJ2](/software/imagej2) types.

-   [IJToolsUsingOpenCV](https://github.com/WAKU-TAKE-A/IJToolsUsingOpenCV): a suite of plugins for the [original ImageJ](/software/imagej) that connects ImageJ with some of the algorithms implemented in OpenCV.
