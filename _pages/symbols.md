## Symbols

Our site supports a predetermined list of frequently used symbols. If you would like to use a symbol not on our lists, you can add it to the page as an image file with the [include image](/demo-image) feature, or encode it directly with html using [UTF-8](https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_html_utf8.asp).
The site currently supports the following symbols as includes:
<br>
This text: {% raw %} `{% include yes %}` produces a green check: {% endraw %} {% include yes %}
This text: {% raw %} `{% include no %}` {% endraw %} produces a red X: {% include no %}
This text: {% raw %} `{% include arrow %}` {% endraw %} produces an greater than symbol: &nbsp;&nbsp; "{% include arrow %}"
