# Purpose

Demonstrate how to call ImageJ's editor and extend the menu in a Jython script.

It also helps you to edit the current lookup table as a list of triplets denoting the red/green/blue values.

You can also use the script to import lookup tables you have in the form of 256 red/green/blue triplets.
