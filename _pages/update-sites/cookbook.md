This page documents the [Cookbook update site](http://sites.imagej.net/Cookbook/). See also [list of update sites](/list-of-update-sites).

## Purpose

The Cookbook update site is a recasting of the defunct [MBF ImageJ plugins](/software/mbf-imagej), to make much of its functionality available within [Fiji](/software/fiji).

Some of the [Scientific Imaging tutorial](/imaging) articles on this wiki reference plugins from this Cookbook collection.

## Installation

To activate it:

-   [{% include bc path='Help|Update...'%}](/update-sites)
-   Click {% include button label="Manage update sites" %}
-   Check the *Cookbook* box
-   Click {% include button label="Close" %}

Some files should appear on the list with *Status/Action* of *Install it*.

-   Click {% include button label="Apply changes" %}
-   Restart ImageJ

Your ImageJ should now possess additional commands in the {% include bc path='Cookbook'%} menu.
