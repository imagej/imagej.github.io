This is a repository (update site) containing custom plugins and scripts created at the IMCF / Uni Basel, as well as some collected ImageJ plugins we are using that are not (yet) included in Fiji.

# Instructions

To add the repository to your list of FiJi update sites, use this address:

- [https://sites.imagej.net/UniBas-IMCF/](https://sites.imagej.net/UniBas-IMCF/)

Please see [how to follow a 3rd party update site](/update-sites/following) for detailed instructions how to enable an additional update site in your Fiji installation.

PLEASE NOTE: you also need to enable the "IBMP-CNRS" update site that is already configured in Fiji (it's just not active by default). Otherwise the ActionBars won't work.
