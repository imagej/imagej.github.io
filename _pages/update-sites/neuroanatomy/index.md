{% include info-box software='Fiji' name='Neuroanatomy update site' author=author maintainer=maintainer source=source status='Active' category='Plugins, Analysis, Neuroanatomy' %} The Neuroanatomy update site is used for distribution of [SNT](/plugins/snt). A few other (legacy) plugins for *Image Processing for NeuroAnatomy and Tree-like Structures* are also included.

# Installation

The requirements to run the Neuroanatomy suite of plugins are twofold: i) [Fiji](/software/fiji) (i.e., an ImageJ installation subscribed to the Fiji update site) running at least Java 8. If you are running an older version of Java, you can either i) [Download the latest Fiji release](/software/fiji/downloads) (newer releases come pre-bundled with Java 8); or ii) If you have downloaded Fiji while ago and want to keep your existing installation, you will have to download Java 8 and make your [Fiji installation aware of it](/learn/troubleshooting#checking-the-java-version).

**Subscribing to the Neuroanatomy update site:**

1.  Run [{% include bc path='Help|Update...'%}](/update-sites)
2.  Click {% include button label="Manage update sites" %}
3.  Select the *Neuroanatomy* checkbox (see also [list of update sites](/list-of-update-sites))
4.  Click {% include button label="Apply changes" %} and Restart ImageJ

## Notes

SNT has its own [documentation](/plugins/snt). The list of *Image Processing for NeuroAnatomy and Tree-like Structures* ({% include github org='tferr' repo='hIPNAT' label='source' %}) is as follows:
