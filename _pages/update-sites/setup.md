## Introduction

This tutorial explains how to **set up a website to distribute your plugins**. It assumes that your plugins are correctly installed in your local [ImageJ2](/software/imagej2) setup.

## Rationale

See the [Distribution](/contribute/distributing) page for a discussion of the benefits of update sites and how they fit in to plugin development.

## Creating a hosted update site

The easiest method to provide your macros, scripts and plugins to other users, letting them keep up-to-date in the most convenient manner, is to set up an [update site](/update-sites) on the `sites.imagej.net` server, hosted at [LOCI](/orgs/loci).

{% include notice icon="info" content='There are some minimal *Terms of Service* for hosted update sites. See the [Hosted Update Site Terms of Service](/update-sites/tos) for details.' %}

***Please use [this thread on the Image.sc Forum](https://forum.image.sc/t/requests-for-creating-imagej-update-sites/40051/) to request a new update site.***

You can also request:
* The addition or removal of uploader permissions for a given user to a particular site;
* A password reset for your upload account.

To start using your update site, in ImageJ2, start the [Updater](/plugins/updater) with {% include bc path='Help | Update' %} and click on the {% include button label="Manage update sites" %} button:

### Specifying your site

Click the {% include button label="Add update site" %} button. 

<img src="/media/update-sites/add-update-site-1.png" width="770"/>

Optionally, enter a nickname for your site in the **Name** column. In the **URL** column, enter your site's complete URL. Finally, in the **Host** column, enter `webdav:<your-uploader-username>`

### Dedicated plugin update sites

Rather than having a single update site for many plugins, it is highly advised to set up dedicated update sites for each plugin that could be of interest to the community.  
Such dedicated update site can have a more intuitive name.  
A given upload account can own several update sites. To request a new update site for your user account, post your request on the forum (see [related post](https://forum.image.sc/t/distributing-several-update-sites/21219/2)), or on the [ImageJ Gitter](https://gitter.im/imagej/imagej).

## Group update site

In addition to [hosted update sites](/update-sites/setup#creating-a-hosted-update-site), it is possible for groups of people to share an update site.

To create such an update site, post on the [Image.sc Forum](https://forum.image.sc/tags/imagej), or in the [imagej Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/imagej/imagej), requesting the creation of the site on `sites.imagej.net`, including the desired name of the site, as well as the upload users to be granted upload permission to the group update site. An administrator will then create the site skeleton and grant those users upload permission to the new site.

## Adding an update site on your own server

If you have an own server or web space with WebDAV, SFTP or SSH access, you can create a directory in that web space and initialize it as an update site, too. Just call the updater with {% include bc path='Help | Update'%} and click the {% include button label="Manage update sites" %} button:

<img src="/media/mamed-3.jpg" width="770"/>

Now press the {% include button label="Add" %} button, provide a nick name for your update site, the URL of your web space, and *upload information*.

The *upload information* depends on the protocol available for uploading:

| Protocol | Host                                 | Directory on Host |
|----------|--------------------------------------|-------------------|
| WebDAV   | *webdav:*, or *webdav:<webdav-user>* | *.*               |
| SFTP     | *sftp:<sftp-user>@<sftp-host>*       | *<absolute-path>* |
| SSH      | *ssh:<ssh-user>@<ssh-host>*          | *<absolute-path>* |
|          |                                      |                   |

In case you want to use an SFTP/SSH server, it must have an empty, public web accessible folder where you intend to publish your updates. The ImageJ updater will not create that empty folder.

{% include notice icon="tip" content='**A note about SSH and `known_hosts`:** For ImageJ to connect to your server over SSH, you must have configured your SSH credentials as normalâ€”i.e.: `$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts` must contain the host key, and optionally `$HOME/.ssh/config` may contain the host configuration/credentials. We recommend that the given host be specified in `$HOME/.ssh/config` and equipped with a private key.
  
Note that you need to connect with command-line ssh first, to record the finger-print of the host. It might be necessary to call `ssh-keyscan test.imagej.net >> $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts` to ensure the correctly formatted key appears in your configuration file. There is an issue with newer SSH servers offering host keys in `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256` format, but the [JSch](http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/) library wanting them in `ssh-rsa` format instead. If you receive the error `com.jcraft.jsch.JSchException: UnknownHostKey` then you might be bitten by this discrepancy; try using the `ssh-keyscan` invocation above. If you still have trouble, please write to the [Image.sc Forum](https://forum.image.sc/) to troubleshoot further.' %}

*Example:* Let's assume you have SFTP access to a machine known as *imagej.example.org* to the internet, and let's assume that you have a user account *myself* that has write access to the path */var/www/my-update-site/* on that machine that is served via http://imagej.example.org/my-update-site/. Then the line you need to add might look like this:

| Name           | URL                                         | Host                      | Directory on Host        |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| My Update Site | http://imagej.example.org/my-update-site/ | myself@imagej.example.org | /var/www/my-update-site/ |
|                |                                             |                           |                          |

If the update site has not been initialized yet (i.e. if nobody else has initialized that site yet), you will see a dialog like this:

![](/media/update-sites/how-to-setup-a-plugin-distribution-site-6a.jpg)

Just click *OK* and let the updater upload an empty file index (it is stored in the file *db.xml.gz* which is also called the *database* in the documentation of the updater).

## Uploading files to your update site

Note: you cannot simply copy files to your web space; the updater would miss all kinds of important information, and consequently refuse to accept that update site. You **need** to let the updater handle the file uploading.

### Start the [updater](/plugins/updater) and check your update site

First, start the [updater](/plugins/updater):

![](/media/update-sites/how-to-setup-a-plugin-distribution-site-1.jpg)

Click on the {% include button label="Manage update sites" %} button and verify:

-   Your update site is present and enabled
-   The *Host* column of your update site contains your user name, in the form: `webdav:`<UploadUsername>

For example:

<img src="/media/update-sites/personal-update-site-7.png" width="770"/>

Once your login information is set you can *Close* the update site window.

### Prepare your files for upload

Click on the {% include button label="Advanced mode" %} button and set the view options to see your plugins:

-   If your have never uploaded your plugins, select *View local-only files*

**For .ijm macro**, the files must be located in the *macro* or *scripts* folder (or any subfolder in it).

**For .py scripts**, they can be either in the *Jars/Lib* or *scripts* folder (or any subfolder).

Out of those folder, the updater might not see them.

-   If you are uploading new versions of your plugins, select *View locally modified files only*

In this case, the plugin we'll be uploading is contained in *A\_Jolly\_Useful\_Plugin.jar*.

Select the file to upload, click under the *Stats/Action* column, or right-click (on macOS, {% include key keys='Ctrl|Left Click' %}) in any column, for the context menu and select *Upload to <update site name>*.

<img src="/media/update-sites/upload-to-update-site.png" width="770"/>

{% include notice icon="info" content='The *Upload to <update site name>* option is only available if you entered your [upload credentials](#start-the-updater-and-check-your-update-site) and no other changes are pending. This is to avoid potentially corrupting your ImageJ installation. If the Upload option is not available, select the *View changes* view and resolve any pending changes - e.g. by updating or reverting to **Keep as-is**.' %}

### Modifying Dependencies

When a plugin is selected, a *Details* panel becomes available. The plugin's dependencies, e.g. *ij.jar* and *someJarOrOther.jar*, are automatically determined by the updater. Hence if you require 3rd party packages for your plugin you can place them into the jars folder of ImageJ and the updater will automatically upload them to the site.

You can also manually enter or edit any information in the *Details* panel:

<img src="/media/update-sites/how-to-setup-a-plugin-distribution-site-15.jpg" width="770"/>

{% include notice icon="info" content='The *Details* panel can only be edited if you have entered upload credentials for the appropriate update site. After modifying the *Details* panel you can mark the jar for upload, even though the jar contents itself has not changed.' %}

{% include notice icon="warning" content='Sometimes the updater will mis-detect your dependencies. This may prevent you from uploading to your update site! If a dependency is wrong, you can manually add or delete dependencies from the *Details* tab to correct the problem. Please [let us know](/discuss) when this happens so we can try to improve the updater' %}

### Upload your files

Finally, click *Apply changes (upload)* to upload your plugin to the server and allow others to access it. If you have dependencies that are not part of ImageJ, the updater will ask you if you want to upload that jar as well. Finally, you will be asked for your login credentials again and the files will be uploaded to the server.

Check that your plugins are now registered as ImageJ plugins by selecting the *View files of the '\[your site name here\]' site* view option:

<img src="/media/update-sites/updaterfinalscreen.jpg" width="770"/>

That's it - you're done. Now, anyone who wants a copy of your plugins merely needs to [add your update site](/update-sites/following) to the Update manger via the URL you specified, and your plugins will be downloaded and updated in their ImageJ installations just like the standard ImageJ plugins.  
For even more visibility and practicability, you can ask to have your update site listed in the Fiji Updater (see section below).

## Publishing your update site

If you want your update site to be listed in the ImageJ update manager, follow the instructions at this page : [list of update sites](/list-of-update-sites)
.
