I am a PhD student at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. My research knowledge area is on biomedical image processing and analysis, basically with different MRI techniques such as DTI, DWI, PWI and SWI.

Please, visit our research group [website](http://dcm.ffclrp.usp.br/csim) to find out some of my publications and personal information.

I created some PlugIn or PlugInFilters for ImageJ, based on some of my research methods or even only create simple tools for image research. See the list below and be free to enter in contact with me to do suggestions or participate for PlugIn implementations in GitHub respository.
