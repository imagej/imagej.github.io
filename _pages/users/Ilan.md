Installation
------------

After installing Fiji, go to "/help" =&gt; "Update..." =&gt; "Manage update site" =&gt; select "PET-CT" =&gt; apply change.

This will bring up a list of all plugins, not all of which need be installed. For example you may not want Read\_ClearCanvas\_Studies.jar and/or Read\_BI\_Studies.jar. In such cases click on "Status/Action" and choose "Keep as-is"

### The software

-   Pet\_Ct\_Viewer.jar
    This is the basic package needed by all other plugins. [Help](http://sourceforge.net/p/bifijiplugins/wiki/Pet-Ct%20Viewer/)
-   Read\_CD.jar
    This reads from multiple sources and automatically calls Pet Ct Viewer if appropriate. [Help](http://sourceforge.net/p/bifijiplugins/wiki/CD%20Dialog/)
-   Gastric\_Emptying.jar
    This contains multiple Nuclear Medicine and general purpose programs:

    -   Gastric Emptying [Help](http://sourceforge.net/p/bifijiplugins/wiki/Gastric%20Emptying/)
    -   Renal Clearance [Help](http://sourceforge.net/p/bifijiplugins/wiki/Renal%20Clearance/)
    -   Save As Dicom [Help](http://sourceforge.net/p/bifijiplugins/wiki/Save%20as%20myDicom/)
    -   Postage Stamps [Help](http://sourceforge.net/p/bifijiplugins/wiki/Postage%20stamps/)
    -   Mask [Help](http://sourceforge.net/p/bifijiplugins/wiki/Mask/)
-   Read\_BI\_Studies.jar
    This is for read-write to the Beth Israel miniPacs. [Help](http://sourceforge.net/p/bifijiplugins/wiki/Reading%20studies/) The program to set up the database [createBIdatabase.jar](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bifijiplugins/files/) is not part of Fiji and needs to be downloaded and run separately. [Help](http://sourceforge.net/p/bifijiplugins/wiki/BI%20Database/)
-   Read\_ClearCanvas\_Studies.jar
    This is used for reading Clear Canvas studies. [Help](http://sourceforge.net/p/bifijiplugins/wiki/Clear%20Canvas%20Dialog/)
-   StartupMacros.ijm
    This is the suggested list of programs to automatically start when Fiji is started.
