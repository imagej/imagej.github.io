Thanks to Nico Stuurman of
[Micro-Manager](http://www.micro-manager.org/) fame, we have a download
mirror at [University of San
Francisco](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~schindelin/)\!

It has been reported that the download speeds to our server were not
always high, as reported by some users, who were happy to report that
the download mirror fixed their issues\!
