We are done filing an initial set of Trac tickets for the [ImageJDev](ImageJ2 "wikilink") project. We have defined five initial milestones:

1.  [Progress report](http://trac.imagej.net/milestone/progress-report), for 7/1/2010
2.  [ImageJ 2.0 beta](http://trac.imagej.net/milestone/imagej-2.0-beta), for 1/1/2011
3.  [ImageJ 2.0 release](http://trac.imagej.net/milestone/imagej-2.0-release), for 7/1/2011
4.  [ImageJ 2.5](http://trac.imagej.net/milestone/imagej-2.5), for 1/1/2012
5.  [ImageJ 3.0+](http://trac.imagej.net/milestone/imagej-3.0), no release date

You can use the [roadmap view](http://trac.imagej.net/roadmap) to see milestone progress. Or if you would rather have a big list of tickets on one page, see [open tickets by milestone](http://trac.imagej.net/report/3) or [all tickets by milestone](http://trac.imagej.net/report/6).

Many of the tickets are quite high level at the moment, and will ultimately need to be broken down into more concrete tasks. But hopefully the tickets there now help to clarify the ImageJDev project's directions.
