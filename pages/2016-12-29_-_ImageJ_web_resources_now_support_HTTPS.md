Over the past many months, we have been incrementally working toward
support for HTTPS (i.e., secure) web traffic for ImageJ's web-based
resources. At the [recent hackathon at
MPI-CBG](2016-12-20_-_Fiji_+_KNIP_hackathon "wikilink"), we largely
completed these efforts. Some of the domains which now fully support
HTTPS include:

  - https://imagej.net/
  - https://downloads.imagej.net/
  - https://javadoc.imagej.net/
  - https://jenkins.imagej.net/
  - https://maven.imagej.net/
  - https://mirror.imagej.net/
  - https://search.imagej.net/
  - https://sites.imagej.net/
  - https://status.imagej.net/
  - https://update.imagej.net/
  - https://wsr.imagej.net/
  - https://fiji.sc/
  - https://samples.fiji.sc/
  - https://update.fiji.sc/

More work is still needed to make the [ImageJ
Updater](ImageJ_Updater "wikilink") always prefer talking to update
sites via HTTPS rather than HTTP; see [the relevant forum
thread](http://forum.imagej.net/t/https-to-make-imagej-fiji-more-secure/398)
for further details.

This work will make ImageJ and Fiji more secure, preventing potential
man-in-the-middle attacks and arbitrary code injection.
