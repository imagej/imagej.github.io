## How to work with surface plots

You can download example source code for this HowTo
[here](3D_Viewer:_Example_code "wikilink").

Before reading this HowTo, it may be helpful to read [The relation
between Content and Universe](3D_Viewer:_Content_Structure "wikilink").

Surface plots show a 2D image as a 3D plot, where the 3rd dimension is
given by the intensity.

Because only one slice of an image stack can be displayed a time,
`SurfacePlot2D` offers a method to set the displayed slice:

``` java
    // Add the image as a volume
    Content c = univ.addSurfacePlot(imp);


    // Retrieve the SurfacePlotGroup
    SurfacePlotGroup splot = (SurfacePlotGroup)c.getContent();

    // Scroll through the slices
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 15; i++) {
        splot.setSlice(i + 1);

    }
```
