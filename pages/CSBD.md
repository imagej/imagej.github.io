The [Center for Systems Biology Dresden (CSBD)](http://www.csbdresden.de) is an initiative of the Max-Planck Society in collaboration with the Technische Universität Dresden ([TUD](http://www.tu-dresden.de)), one of the eleven German Excellence Universities. It was started in 2010 by the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics ([MPI-CBG](MPI-CBG "wikilink")) and the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems ([MPI-PKS](https://www.pks.mpg.de)) with the generous support of the Saxon State Ministry for Higher Education, Research and the Arts, the BMBF, and the Klaus Tschira Stiftung. The center was built on the joint interdisciplinary research program between [MPI-CBG](MPI-CBG "wikilink") and [MPI-PKS](https://www.pks.mpg.de).
