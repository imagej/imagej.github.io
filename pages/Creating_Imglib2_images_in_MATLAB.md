This page recenses experiments with creating ImgLib2 images from
[MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink"), and then calling ImgLib2 algorithm from
[MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink"). We aim first at showing how to build
ImgLib2 types from [MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink") types, then to do that
efficiently. By this we mean having to <b>share</b> a single, massive
low level data piece between ImgLib2 and [MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink"),
which is not doable simply due to [MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink") memory
model.

All snippets listed here are to be run from [MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink").
We rely on [Miji](Miji "wikilink") to set up class path, so you have to
start every [MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink") session with the command

``` matlab
Miji(false)
```

## Creating a new ImgLib2 image in MATLAB

In [MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink"), we are limited to native type images
(float, uint8, uint16, ...) represented as native arrays. The matching
ImgLib2 container for this is the .

Because ImgLib2 authors wrote nice static utilities, our work is
relatively easy. The class `ArrayImgs` has all the methods you need, one
per native type.

``` matlab
>> load clown
>> img = net.imglib2.img.array.ArrayImgs.doubles(X(:), size(X));
>> net.imglib2.img.display.imagej.ImageJFunctions.show(img); % ImageJ display
>> imshow(X,[]) % [[MATLAB]] display
```

![MatlabToImglib2\_clown.png](MatlabToImglib2_clown.png
"MatlabToImglib2_clown.png")

We note that the ImageJ display is rotated and flipped regarding the
[MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink") image. This is because
[MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink") arrays are expected to be arranged along
columns, whereas Java arrays are arranged along lines. We would need to
permute dimension 0 and dimension 1 to display the data in ImageJ as
expected in [MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink").

Note also that the raw data was cast from 64-bit double data to 32-bit
float for display. But the source `img` has the expected type.

## MATLAB to ImgLib2 bridge functions

The exacts method in `ArrayImgs` depend on the native type you want to
use, so you would have to deal with all possible cases. But there is
already some [MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink") functions in Fiji that does
that in the `scripts` folder of your Fiji installation:  and . You need
therefore to add `scripts` to your [MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink") path, but
this is most likely already done since it also contains `Miji` which you
need to call already.

The first function generates a plain `Img`. The second one generates and
`ImgPlus` which allows you specifying the spatial calibration, image
name and axis types. Check the help of these functions for details.

## Example usage

Let's put ImgLib2 to work to filter a source image using anisotropic
diffusion:

``` matlab
load clown
Miji(false);
img = copytoImg(X);
for i = 1 : 10 % do it 10 times, in place
    net.imglib2.algorithm.pde.PeronaMalikAnisotropicDiffusion.inFloatInPlace(img, 0.15, 10);
end
net.imglib2.img.display.imagej.ImageJFunctions.show(img);
```

## Retrieving the content of an ImgLib2 image in MATLAB

Now we want to get the result back in [MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink"). Since
we are using `ArrayImg`, we can always access the underlying java
primitive array that the `Img` wraps, but we still have to keep in mind
the X and Y dimension permutation. Also: the wrapped array is a 1D, very
long array, that can be looked upon as the row-by-row concatenation of
the image content. We have to reshape it in [MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink")
to give the image back its aspect:

``` matlab
% Retrieve a copy (see below) of the java primitive array
>> I = img.update([]).getCurrentStorageArray; 
% Reshape it to match the initial aspect. Careful, we need to remember we permuted X & Y.
>> J = reshape(I, size(X'));  % X' not X
% Display it with X & Y permuted
>> imshow(J', [])
```

This is all and nice and worked as expected. But it worked because we
were using `double`s for this image. Let's try with a more memory-saving
type. First, let's create a `uint8` image from a
[MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink") array of this type:

``` matlab
>> clear
>> load clown
>> Y = ind2gray(X, map);
>> Z = uint8(255*Y); 
>> imshow(Z)
>> img = copytoImg(Z);
>> net.imglib2.img.display.imagej.ImageJFunctions.show(img);
```

This just builds an acceptable [MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink") uint8 image
and a UnsignedByteType ImgLib2 image. Let's suppose we modified this
image, keeping its type, and want to retrieve the content in
[MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink"). We do just like before:

``` matlab
>> I = img.update([]).getCurrentStorageArray; 
>> J = reshape(I, size(X'));  % X' not X
>> imshow(J', [])
```

![MatlabToImglib2\_int8.png](MatlabToImglib2_int8.png
"MatlabToImglib2_int8.png")

What happened here? The gray levels are all messed up. Checking the
class of the returned array gives a clue:

``` matlab
>> class(J)
```

` ans =`  
` `  
` int8`

Aha\! So we gave to ImgLib2 an uint8 array, but it gives us back an int8
array, with all values wrapped. This is actually something that should
have been expected: There is no unsigned byte type in Java, only signed
byte type. This is a language design choice we could discuss for hours,
but in Java there just isn't uint8 or uint16\[1\].

ImgLib2 developers managed to deal with it elegantly. Since the library
can abstract about everything, having an image type which is not
directly backed up by an existing primitive type is not a problem. The
uint8 is represented internally by something Java can handle, and
ImgLib2 makes sure the unsigned byte type arithmetics are respected
whenever the image content is retrieved or display.

But when we call the `getCurrentStorageArray` method, we retrieve this
internal representation, and it just happens that it is of type `int8`,
that is signed byte. The values are a bit mixed, since `int8` ranges
from -128 to 127, while `uint8` range from 0 to 255.
[MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink") has a built-in function to put it back
right:

``` matlab
>> I = img.update([]).getCurrentStorageArray; 
>> J = typecast(I, 'uint8');
>> K = reshape(J, size(X'));
>> imshow(K')
```

But of course, there is a [MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink") function that does
all of this for you, and that you can also find in the scripts folder of
your Fiji installation: .

## MATLAB arrays are not shared

We expect the underlying raw data - an array of doubles - to be shared
between [MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink") and ImgLib2. Unfortunately, it isn't
so. Let's try to turn the first column entirely white

``` matlab
>> close all
>> X(:,1) = 255;
>> imshow(X,[])
>> net.imglib2.img.display.imagej.ImageJFunctions.show(img);
```

It did not work: the ImgLib2 image did not see the change. This means
that it does not wrap <b>the</b> [MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink") array, but
a copy of it. This is a shame and this is of crucial importance. Not
only we might have some very large data to process we wish not to
duplicate in memory, but we might want to take advantage of some ImgLib2
algorithms that run *in place* and modify the source image.

This is by construction, and there is no workaround, at least for
Java\[2\]. [MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink") passes all the data *per-value*,
not *per-reference* and this is what happened here.

## Using Java arrays in MATLAB

A first attempt to solve this would be to try and use Java arrays in
[MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink"), which is made possible by the function
`javaArray`. As explained in the [[MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink")
docs](http://www.mathworks.fr/fr/help/matlab/matlab_external/working-with-java-arrays.html),
you can use this function to instantiate proper Java arrays, which we
could then use to create an ImgLib2 image, and play with the same data
both on the [MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink") side and on the ImgLib2 side.

But this would unsatisfactory as well. The `javaArray` function allows
the creation of Java *objects*, but not of *primitive types*. As
suggested on the [MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink") docs, and noted
[here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5554518/can-matlab-not-read-back-a-double-array-from-java):

` `[`MATLAB`](MATLAB "wikilink")` can pass Java objects when calling a Java function, and modifications to `  
` these objects are afterwards available in `[`MATLAB`](MATLAB "wikilink")` - `<u>`except when the Java `  
` object is an array of a primitive data type`</u>`. In this case automatic conversion`  
` between `[`MATLAB`](MATLAB "wikilink")` and Java kicks in, making a Java array-of-primitive-double `  
` correspond directly to a double matrix in `[`MATLAB`](MATLAB "wikilink")` - which is by `[`MATLAB`](MATLAB "wikilink")` `  
` conventions a thing "passed as value" so no return values are possible.`

So this means that we could create an array of `java.lang.Double[]` and
use its reference, but we cannot have and manipulate a plain native
`double[]` array without [MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink") shadowing any
change because it operates on a copy.

An array of `java.lang.Double[]` is not acceptable for most of our use
cases. We expect to deal sometimes with very large images - the main
reason for trying to escape duplicating data in memory - and a `Double`
object adds some overhead on the primitive it wraps we would like to
avoid.

As of now ([MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink") 2013a), this answer seems to be
definitive: There is no workaround if we are to stay with a native array
in [MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink").

## Using ImgLib2 types as primary data holder

Therefore, a solution implies a change of approach. We will not use
[MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink") matrices as data holder, but use ImgLib2
structures. We can access the raw data through ImgLib2 facilities
(cursor, randomAcess, ...). The changes made are then done *in place*,
and will be visible from both ImgLib2 and [MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink"),
provided the data is accessed from the ImgLib2 container. We also
already saw that `ArrayImg`s wrap a native array, that we can copy to
[MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink") shall we need to quickly get the whole
dataset.

With this strategy, [MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink") steps aside a bit, since
we use ImgLib2 for basically all data manipulation. It takes the role of
a scripting language like [Jython](Jython_Scripting "wikilink"), from
which you make plain call to Java classes. Duplicating the native array
wrapped in an `ArrayImg` allows you still make the best our of
[MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink") easily, but you must design a good tactic in
your script to avoid these local copies to exist for too long.
