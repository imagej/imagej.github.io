{% include warning-box content='This is an experimental plugin, and I have doubts about its correctness—in particular, the results are strange when the ratio of pixelWidth : pixelHeight : pixelDepth is other than 1:1:1. In addition, the results in any case seem to be different from those from other implementations, such as [this [MATLAB](MATLAB "wikilink") one](http://www.mathworks.co.uk/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24409-hessian-based-frangi-vesselness-filter). I don"t have time to work on this any more (and no longer work in academia at all) so if someone were interested in taking it over, that would be brilliant.' %} {% include component-stats content=':sc.fiji:Feature\_Detection' %} This plugin implements the algorithm for detection of vessel- or tube-like structures in 2D and 3D images described Frangi et al 1998. \[1\]

In my experience, this method produces consistently better results than the [Tubeness](Tubeness "wikilink") plugin for isotropic image data, although it is significantly slower.

These screenshots show the results on an example file:
