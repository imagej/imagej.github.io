The [Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics
(MPI-CBG)](http://www.mpi-cbg.de) is a research institute in Dresden,
Germany, pioneering basic research. 500 curiosity-driven scientists from
over 50 countries collectively ask: How do cells form tissues? Hence,
the research programs at the MPI-CBG span multiple scales of magnitude,
from molecular assemblies to organelles, cells, tissues, organs, and
organisms.

The MPI-CBG is also the place where the [Fiji](Fiji "wikilink") project
was started and is still one of the key contributors to Fiji and its
supporting infrastructure.
