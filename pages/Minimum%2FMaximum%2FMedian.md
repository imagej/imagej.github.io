## Purpose

A 3D version of the minimum, maximum and median filter.

## Description

Each voxel is set to the minimum, maximum or median value of its
neighborhood.

The neighborhood is defined by a kernel, which has a diameter of 3
voxels.

The image below shows the effect of each of the filters, using the MRI
sample image which comes with ImageJ and Fiji.
