## Summary

This package contains tools for Stractec pQCT soft-tissue and bone
images. It's designed for the following analyses:

  - Conventional bone analyses (e.g. cortical area and volumetric bone
    mineral density)
  - Regional bone mineral density calculations (density
    distribution<sup>1</sup>)
  - Bone marrow analysis for a tubular bone<sup>2</sup>
  - Conventional soft tissue analyses (e.g. subcutaneous fat
    cross-sectional area, muscle cross-sectional area)<sup>2</sup>

before running this tool.

![selections.png](selections.png "selections.png")

  - **Flip horizontal**: flips the image horizontally

<!-- end list -->

  - **Flip vertical**: flips the image vertically

<!-- end list -->

  - **No filtering**: prevents *3x3* median filtering of bone and *7x7*
    filtering of soft tissue.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Measurement tube**: removes the tube used for lower limb
    measurements with some versions of the XCT3000 measurement device.

-----

  - **Air threshold**: threshold for foreground pixels (all tissue).
    Pixels with values less than this are considered background.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Fat threshold**: pixels with values \(air \leq x < fat\) are
    considered fat tissue.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Muscle threshold**: threshold value for muscle tissue.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Marrow threshold**: separates marrow from bone. Pixels \(\leq\)
    the threshold within bone area are considered marrow.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Soft tissue threshold**: separates bone from soft-tissue. Pixels
    \(\geq\) the threshold are considered soft-tissue.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Area threshold**: separates bone from everything else. Used for
    total area (*ToA*) and bmd (*ToD*) as well as for cortical area
    (*CoA*) and *SSI* and *BSId* calculations.

<!-- end list -->

  - **BMD threshold**: separates cortical bone from everything else.
    Used for density distribution and cortical density (CoD) analyses.

-----

  - **Scaling coefficient**: Used as the coefficient to scale the raw
    integer values read from the image file into *BMD* values , i.e. the
    raw-value term \(b\) in \(y = a+bx\) (N.B. in case of Stratec files
    a value of \(2^{15}\) is subtracted prior to applying the scaling to
    account for the fact that the values were stored as 16-bit signed
    integers , while ImageJ uses 16-bit unsigned integers. Also, the
    scaling is retrieved from a list of Stratec .TYP-files according to
    the image header information. In case of DICOM-files, the DICOM
    scaling (typically \(y = -1000+1x\)) is applied prior to applying
    this scaling.).

<!-- end list -->

  - **Scaling constant**: Used as the constant in scaling the raw
    integer values read from the image file into *BMD* values, i.e. term
    \(a\) in \(y = a+bx\).

-----

  - **ROI selection**: Chooses which bone is analysed. Results are
    always produced for one bone at a time.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Soft Tissue ROI selection**: Used to define, which soft tissue
    area is analysed. Results are always produced for one soft tissue
    area at a time.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Rotation selection**: Used to define, how the mass distribution,
    concentric density distribution and density distribution results are
    aligned.

-----

  - **Analyse cortical results**: Whether (ticked) or not to analyse
    *ToA*, *ToD*, *SSI*, *CoA*, *CoD* and *BSId*.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Analyse mass distribution**: Whether (ticked) or not to analyse
    mass distribution.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Analyse concentric density distribution**: Whether (ticked) or not
    to analyse concentric density distribution. Useful for e.g. distal
    bone without medullary cavity. Analyses density distribution in 10
    anatomical concentric rings starting from the center of the bone
    area.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Analyse density distribution**: Whether (ticked) or not to analyse
    density distribution. N.B. will not produce meaningful results for
    bones without medullary cavity.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Analyse soft tissues**: Whether (ticked) or not to analyse soft
    tissues.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Prevent peeling PVE pixels**: Whether (ticked) or not to prevent
    peeling outermost and innermost layer of pixels in density
    distribution analysis. Useful e.g. for enabling analysis in subjects
    with thin cortices. N.B. having included PVE pixels should be kept
    in mind while interpreting the results\!

<!-- end list -->

  - **Allow cleaving**: Used to separate bone/soft tissue areas, which
    are connected with a narrow struct. Cleaving is made by looking at
    the ratios of distances between two points along the edge and the
    shortest distance between the points. If the maximum of the ratio is
    high enough, the highest ratio points will be connected with a
    straight line and one of the resulting edges will be discarded. E.g.
    for a circle, the maximum ratio is
    \(\frac{\pi}{2} / d \approx 1.57\) and for a square it's
    \(\frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.41\).

<!-- end list -->

  - **Suppress result image**: The analysis pops up a result image,
    which may be suppressed by ticking this box. Useful e.g. for batch
    processing.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Limit ROI search to manually selected**: If ticked, only manually
    delineated ROI will be searched for a bone and soft tissue (The ROI
    selected with ImageJ ROI tools prior to executing the Distribution
    Analysis is used).

<!-- end list -->

  - **Set distribution results rotation manually**: If ticked, the
    density distribution results will be rotated according to the value
    given in the text box below.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Manual rotation**: If the box above is ticked, the density
    distribution results will be rotated according to the degree value
    given here (useful, e.g. when the automatic rotation fails).

-----

  - **Guess flip**: If ticked, will allow trying to guess whether
    results need to be flipped.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Guess right**: If ticked, will try to guess whether results need
    to be flipped. If selected bone is closer to image left/upper border
    (Stacked not ticked or ticked, respectively), the results are not
    flipped.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Guess larger**: If ticked, will try to guess whether results need
    to be flipped. If larger bone is closer to image left/upper border
    (Stacked not ticked or ticked, respectively), the results are not
    flipped.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Stacked bones**: Used only if guess right or guess larger is
    ticked. Stacked means that the bones are expected to be on top of
    each other in the image (e.g. tibial mid-shaft in Stratec images).

<!-- end list -->

  - **Guess stacked**: Used only if guess right or guess larger is
    ticked. Tries to guess whether the bones are stacked. The default
    guess is not, but if the y-axis distance of the centers of the two
    largest bones differs by more than 1.1 time the x-axis distance, the
    bones are considered stacked.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Invert flip guess**: If ticked will invert the flip guess made by
    guess right or guess larger. Useful for e.g. analyzing two bones
    from the same image in order to align the distribution results
    similarly.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Flip distribution results**: If ticked, the distribution results
    will be flipped to a mirror image. Useful for e.g. comparing left to
    right leg.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Save visual result image on disk**: If ticked, will save visual
    result image on disk into the path given in the text box below.
    Useful e.g. for batch processing, allowing visual inspection of the
    results after running the batch.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Image save path**: If the above check box is ticked, the path
    given in this text box is used as the path into which the visual
    result images are saved to, i.e. c:/path/to/save/to/. remember to
    add the trailing /. Either / or \\ may be used in the path.

## Distribution analysis results

### Alignment

  - Endo- and pericortical radii, and endo-, mid- and pericortical
    densities are produced for each \(10^\circ\) sector.
  - The sector from \(0^\circ\) to \(10^\circ\) always opens directly to
    right in the visual result image.
  - Sectors increase into clockwise direction in the visual results
    image, or counter clockwise, if results are flipped.
      - If you have selected flip distribution results, the sectors are
        still the same, but you will notice that the visual distribution
        result has been mirrored about the horizontal axis. This
        flipping is implemented by reversing the distribution results
        vectors and by making sure that the sector from \(0^\circ\) to
        \(10^\circ\) remains the same.
      - The color of the line used to delineate the endo- and
        pericortical border indicates in which direction the sector
        angle increases. \(0^\circ\) is blue and \(360^\circ\) is
        green/red.
      - In addition, the original and rotated x- and y- axes are
        highlighted in the visual image (the origin of which is the
        origin of the distribution results). The axes extend from origin
        towards positive coordinate values, green/cyan x-axis and
        blue/purple y-axis.

### Interpretation

**Polar distribution**  
![polar.png](polar.png "polar.png")  
The mean of the three radial divisions within a given sector is reported
as the density of that sector. Applies to:

  - 0° - 10° ... 350° - 360° mineral mass \[mg\]
  - Polar sector \#0 ... \#35 vBMD \[mg/cm³\]

**Radial distribution**  
![radial.png](radial.png "radial.png")  
The mean of the thirty six 10° sectors within a given anatomical ring is
reported as the density of that ring. Applies to:

  - Radial division \#0 ... \#2 vBMD \[mg/cm³\]

**Polar and radial distribution**  
\* Combination of the two above

  - Division X sector 0° - 10° ... 350° - 360° vBMD \[mg/cm³\]
  - 0° - 10° ... 350° - 360° endo/mid/pericortical vBMD \[mg/cm³\]

**Radii distribution**  
\* 0° - 10° ... 350° - 360° concentric analysis pericortical radius
\[mm\]

  - 0° - 10° ... 350° - 360° endo/pericortical radius \[mm\]

![radii.png](radii.png "radii.png")  
Endo- and pericortical radii are given as the distance from the centroid
of the marrow cavity to the endo- and pericortical border, respectively.
The radii are calculated prior to peeling off the layers of pixels from
endosteal and periosteal border.

## Export Stratec Header

Displays the metadata saved in the pQCT image currently open.

## Strip Stracted Header

Can be used to save a new version of the given image file, where
selected metadata fields have been stripped.

## Read Stratec File

Use this plug-in to open Stratec pQCT images. NB  or dragging the file
doesn't work.

## Test images

You can download the
[package](http://bonej.org/images/SyntheticData.zip) that contains test
images for the analyses. The source to produce the synthetic data and
the expected results are also included.

To easily run the test, use the provided
[macro](http://bonej.org/images/SyntheticDataTest.ijm). Instructions:

1.  Prepare the .ijm macro file before the first time you run it
    
    1.  Open SyntheticDataTest.ijm
    2.  Change the paths on line 2 and 3 to ones that match your
        computer, e.g.: line 2: sourceDir =
        C:/your/path/to/synthetic/images/. line 3: visualDir =
        C:/your/path/to/visual/results/. Remember the trailing "/"
        characters. N.B. The paths need to exist prior to executing the
        macro. In addition, windows operating system does not seem to
        work if the path contains spaces. If you are working with
        windows and do have spaces in your path, replace the / with
        \\\\.
    3.  Save the .ijm file

2.  Open Fiji / ImageJ

3.  
4.  Find your .ijm file

5.  When the macro has finished, you should see the Results table

6.  Open the resulting file with excel or open office or some other
    suitable program and the results should match the ones within the
    Synthetic data provided above.

## BoneJ and pQCT

[BoneJ](http://bonej.org) and pQCT are separating. If you install pQCT
from the update site as described above, you won't need BoneJ. The
former is still included in JAR available at bonej.org, but they will
become completely independent. In the meanwhile, please don't install
both pQCT from the update site, and the BoneJ JAR.
