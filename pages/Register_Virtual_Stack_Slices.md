|}

This plugin takes a sequence of image slices stored in a folder, and
delivers a list of registered image slices (with enlarged canvas). One
of the images in the sequence can be selected by the user as
**reference** and it will remain intact.

The plugin can perform*' 6 types of image registration techniques*':

  - Translation
  - Rigid (translation + rotation)
  - Similarity (translation + rotation + isotropic scaling)
  - Affine
  - Elastic (via [ bUnwarpJ](BUnwarpJ "wikilink") with cubic B-splines)
  - Moving least squares

All models are aided by automatically extracted [ SIFT
features](Feature_Extraction "wikilink").

## User Manual

<b>Premises</b>:  

  - **Source folder**: You have a folder with an ordered list of image
    files in it that ImageJ can open.
  - Each image represents a slice in a sequence.
  - **Output folder**: You have or create a folder to store the
    resulting virtual stack with the aligned images.

Images may have different dimensions and be of different type.

<b>Step 1</b>: launch the "Plugins - Registration - Register Virtual
Stack Slices" plugin.

![Register Virtual Stack main window](Rvs_main_window.png
"Register Virtual Stack main window")

<b>Step 2</b>: choose the appropriate options:  

  - **Select a source folder** containing the slices, at one slice per
    image file.
  - **Select the output folder** where resulting registered slices are
    automatically stored as TIFF files.
  - **Feature extraction model**. The expected transformation model
    finding inliers (i.e. correspondences or landmarks between images)
    in the feature extraction: translation, rigid, similarity or affine.
  - **Registration model**. The image transformation model: translation,
    rigid, similarity, affine, elastic or moving least squares.
  - **Advanced setup**. The advanced checkbox: whether to see the [
    feature extraction
    parameters](Feature_Extraction#Parameters "wikilink") setup dialog,
    and if elastic, the [ bUnwarpJ](BUnwarpJ "wikilink") dialog.
    Otherwise the plugin operates on reasonable, default parameters.
  - **Shrinkage constrain**. Option to regularize the registration in
    order to avoid section shrinking.
  - **Save transforms**. Option to save the resulting transforms into
    files, that can be loaded using [Transform Virtual Stack
    Slices](Transform_Virtual_Stack_Slices "wikilink").

<b>Step 3</b>: choose the **reference** image (only if the "Shrinkage
constraint" checkbox was not marked):  

  - Select one of the images from the source folder as the reference
    image.

On success, a virtual stack will open showing all the registered images
contained in the target folder. The virtual stack can be closed with no
ill effect: images are saved in the target folder.

### Shrinkage constrain

![Shrinkage constrain checkbox](RVS_shrink_option.png
"Shrinkage constrain checkbox") Since the 09/13/2009 version and thanks
to [Daniel Berger](http://hebb.mit.edu/), Register Virtual Stack Slices
has the option of constraining the registration to avoid section
shrinking for large sets of images.

If this option is used, **no reference image needs to be selected**. All
images will be transformed into the same common space by initializing
first the system with a rigid transformation and then relaxing it based
on the desired registration model.

To do so, in the main dialog, you have to check the "Shrinkage
constrain" option (see attached window).

If you check as well the "Advance setup" checkbox from the same dialog,
then a new window will appear to select the corresponding parameters to
regularize the section shrinkage based on the properties of the
transformation. If we choose "affine" as registration model, then we
will be able to regularize: ![ Shrinkage regularization parameters
](RVS_regularization_params.png " Shrinkage regularization parameters ")

  - the [shear](wikipedia:Shear_mapping "wikilink"),
  - the [scaling](wikipedia:Scaling_\(geometry\) "wikilink"),
  - and the [isotropy](wikipedia:Isotropy "wikilink") or aspect ratio.

For the registration models "translation" and "rigid", no regularization
is needed since these linear transformations don't apply. In the case of
the "similarity" registration model, only the shearing and scaling will
be regularized.

**TODO**: the "elastic" and "moving least squares" registration models
do not have a proper shrinkage regularization implementation yet.

In the case of the "elastic" model, only a rigid registration will be
performed. If you need to regularize the elastic transformation between
the sections, you better do it through the bUnwarpJ paramters (see [
Notes](Register_Virtual_Stack_Slices#Notes "wikilink") below).

For the "moving least squares" model, the maximal warping will still
take place with no regularization.

We can visualize the relaxation of the system into the desired
registration model by checking the option "Display relaxation graph". In
this graph the average mean squared error (MSE) between the
correspondences of the whole sequence of slices is displayed for each
relaxation iteration.

### Save Transforms

Since the 09/24/2009 version, the plugin has the option to store the
resulting transforms into files. This way, the results can be reproduce
later on the same images or on a difference sequence by using the plugin
[Transform Virtual Stack
Slices](Transform_Virtual_Stack_Slices "wikilink").

To save the transforms, you just have to click on the "Save transforms"
check-box of the main dialog. Then, after selecting the source and
output directories, a new dialog will pop up to select the folder to
store the transforms in.

The transforms are saved as **.XML** files, following
[TrakEM2](TrakEM2 "wikilink") format.

### Notes

1.  The plugin is multithreaded: more CPU cores means faster execution.
2.  The two most relevant parameters in the [ SIFT feature
    extraction](Feature_Extraction "wikilink") are:  
      - <b>maximum image size</b>, which limits the low-end size of the
        features (i.e. decrease maximum image size to increase the size
        of the smallest features to extract.)
      - <b>inlier ratio</b>, which determines when to reject the
        intersection set of feature correspondences between two images
        (ratio between correspondent features vs. all extracted
        features.)
3.  All types of images are accepted (8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit and RGB) but
    only in .tif, .jpg, .png, .gif, .tiff, .jpeg, .bmp, .pgm, or .ima
    format. Output images are saved as TIFF.
4.  If you selected the "Advanced setup" and "Elastic" as registration
    model, another window to adjust the elastic registration parameters
    will be shown.

![Elastic registration options](Rvs_elastic_options_351x446.png
"Elastic registration options")

This is actually a reduced version of the [
bUnwarpJ](BUnwarpJ "wikilink") main window.

Briefly, the options are:

  - **Registration mode**: "Mono", "Accurate" or "Fast". "Mono" means
    unidirectional registration and its actually the fastest of the
    three modes. "Accurate" and "Fast" perform bidirectional
    registration and take more time.
  - **Image Subsampling factor**: the image scaling factor from 2⁰ (1)
    to 2⁷ (128). We recommend to use it if the images are very large.
  - **Initial and Final deformations**: from "Very Coarse" to "Very
    Fine" or "Super Fine". They define the number of B-spline
    coefficients in the deformation grid (from 2x2 to 16x16). More
    coefficients mean more precision but also the possibility of
    over-registering.
  - **Divergence and curl weights**. They regularize the deformation to
    make it smooth.
  - **Landmark weight**: relevance of adjusting the correspondences
    found in the feature extraction.
  - **Image weight**: relevance of the similarity between source and
    target image in the energy function.
  - **Consistency weight**: relevance of the consistency error between
    the direct and inverse deformations (only for "Accurate" or "Fast"
    modes).
  - **Stop threshold**: difference between the last and previous
    algorithm iterations that makes the registration to end.

Even this sequence of rather noisy transmission electron microscopy
images, with considerable variations from slice to slice, got registered
properly:

## Scripting / PlugIn

You can call the plugin in a non-interactive fashion from a jython
script:

``` python
from register_virtual_stack import Register_Virtual_Stack_MT

# source directory
source_dir = "/path/to/source/"
# output directory
target_dir = "/path/to/target/"
# transforms directory
transf_dir = "/path/to/transforms/"
# reference image
reference_name = "reference_image"
# shrinkage option (false)
use_shrinking_constraint = 0

p = Register_Virtual_Stack_MT.Param()
# The "maximum image size":
p.sift.maxOctaveSize = 1024
# The "inlier ratio":
p.minInlierRatio = 0.05

Register_Virtual_Stack_MT.exec(source_dir, target_dir, transf_dir, 
reference_name, p, use_shrinking_constraint)
```
