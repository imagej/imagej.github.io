## SNT API

The most up-to-date SNT API can be found at https://morphonets.github.io/SNT.

## Script Templates

![SNT Scripts Menu](Snt-Scripts-Menu-Full-List.png "SNT Scripts Menu") SNT comes packaged with script templates demonstrating various analysis, tracing, image processing and batch processing routines. These templates can be found both in the *Scripts* menu of the SNT dialog and in the {% include bc content='Templates|Neuroanatomy'%} menu of Fiji's Script Editor. Scripts can be written in any language supported by Fiji's Script Editor.

### Analysis

  - **Analysis\_Demo\_(Interactive).py** Exemplifies how to programmatically interact with a running instance of SNT to analyze traced data. Because of all the GUI updates, this approach is *significantly slower* than analyzing reconstructions directly (see Analysis\_Demo.py for comparison)

<!-- end list -->

  - **Analysis\_Demo.py** A [Jython](Jython "wikilink") demo of how SNT can analyze neuronal reconstructions fetched from online databases such as MouseLight, NeuroMorpho or FlyCircuit.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Download\_ML\_Data.groovy** Exemplifies how to programmatically retrieve data from MouseLight's database at \[//ml-neuronbrowser.janelia.org ml-neuronbrowser.janelia.org\]: It iterates through all the neurons in the server and downloads data (both JSON and SWC formats) for cells with soma associated with the specified Allen Reference Atlas (ARA) compartment. Downloaded files will contain all metadata associated with the cell (i.e., labeling used, strain, etc.)

<!-- end list -->

  - **Get\_Branch\_Points\_in\_Brain\_Compartment.groovy** Exemplifies how to extract morphometric properties of a MouseLight cell associated with a specific brain region/neuropil compartment. Requires internet connection.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Graph\_Analysis.py** Demonstrates how to handle neurons as graph structures [(graph theory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) in which nodes connected by edges define the morphology of the neuron. SNT represents neurons as directed graphs (assuming the root -typically the soma- as origin) and allows data be processed using the powerful [jgrapht](https://jgrapht.org/) library. In this demo, the [graph diameter](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GraphDiameter.html) (i.e., the length of the longest shortest path or the longest graph geodesic) of a cellular compartment is computed for a neuron fetched from the MouseLight database.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Reconstruction\_Viewer\_Demo.py** Exemplifies how to render reconstructions and neuropil annotations in a stand-alone [Reconstruction Viewer](SNT__Reconstruction_Viewer "wikilink").

<!-- end list -->

  - **SciView\_Demo.groovy** Exemplifies how bridge SNT with [SciView](https://imagej.net/SciView).

<!-- end list -->

  - **Extensive\_Sholl\_Stats.groovy** Exemplifies how to perform linear and polynomial regression on tabular [Sholl](Sholl "wikilink") data.

### Boilerplate

This menu hosts script templates containing extensible boilerplate code in several programming languages, namely [BeanShell](BeanShell "wikilink"), [Groovy](Groovy "wikilink") and [Jython](Jython_Scripting "wikilink"). The most essential imports and [script parameters](Script_Parameters "wikilink") are included to facilitate rapid development.

### Tracing

  - **Scripted\_Tracing\_Demo.py** Exemplifies how to programmatically perform A\* tracing between two points without GUI interaction, which allows for automated tracing of relatively simple structures (e.g., neurospheres neurites, microtubule bundles, etc). In this demo, points are retrieved from the SWC file of SNT's "demo tree", effectively recreating the initial SWC data.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Scripted\_Tracing\_Demo\_(Interactive).py** Exemplifies how to programmatically interact with a running instance of SNT to perform auto-tracing tasks.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Take\_Snapshot.py** Displays a WYSIWYG image of a tracing canvas. Exemplifies how to script SNT using SNTService.

### Batch

This menu hosts scripts that process files in bulk. Namely:

  - **Convert\_Traces\_to\_SWC.py** Converts all .traces files in a directory into SWC.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Filter\_Multiple\_Images.py** Bulk filtering of image files using Frangi Vesselness.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Measure\_Multiple\_Files.py**/**Measure\_Multiple\_Files\_(With\_Options).groovy** Bulk measurements of reconstruction files.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Render\_Cell\_Collection.groovy** Exemplifies how to quickly render large collections of cells from a directory of files in [Reconstruction Viewer](SNT__Reconstruction_Viewer "wikilink").

<!-- end list -->

  - **Render\_Cell\_Collection\_(MultiPanel\_Figure).groovy** Exemplifies how to generate a publication-quality multi-panel figure in which multiple reconstructions are sorted and color-coded by a specified morphometric trait (e.g., cable length).

## Python Notebooks

Direct access to the SNT API from the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language is made possible through the [pyimagej](https://pypi.org/project/pyimagej/) module. This enables full integration between SNT and any library in the Python ecosystem (numpy, scipy, etc.). The [Notebooks](https://github.com/morphonets/SNT/tree/master/notebooks) directory in the SNT repository contains several examples at different complexity levels.

Here, we will exemplify basic functionality. Please refer to the complete [examples](https://github.com/morphonets/SNT/tree/master/notebooks) for more details. Once the Python environment is properly [setup](https://github.com/morphonets/SNT/tree/master/notebooks#snt-notebooks), one can initialize Fiji:

``` python
import imagej
ij = imagej.init('sc.fiji:fiji', headless=False)
```

Then, one can use [pyjnius](https://github.com/kivy/pyjnius) (bundled with pyimagej) to import the needed SNT (Java) classes. E.g., to download a neuron reconstruction from the MouseLight database and calculate summary statistics on it, you would import the [MouseLightLoader](https://morphonets.github.io/SNT/index.html?sc/fiji/snt/io/MouseLightLoader.html) and [TreeStatistics](https://morphonets.github.io/SNT/index.html?sc/fiji/snt/analysis/TreeStatistics.html) classes:

``` python
from jnius import autoclass
MouseLightLoader = autoclass('tracing.io.MouseLightLoader')
TreeStatistics   = autoclass('tracing.analysis.TreeStatistics')
```

Now you can access all the attributes and methods these classes offer. Let's get a summary of the inter-node distances for a specific mouse cortical motor neuron (ID = "AA0100" in the [MouseLight database](https://ml-neuronbrowser.janelia.org/)).

``` python
def run():
    loader = MouseLightLoader("AA0100")
    if not loader.isDatabaseAvailable():
        print("Could not connect to ML database", "Error")
        return
    if not loader.idExists():
        print("Somehow the specified id was not found", "Error")
        return

    a_tree = loader.getTree('axon', None) # compartment, color
    s_stats = TreeStatistics(a_tree)
    metric = TreeStatistics.INTER_NODE_DISTANCE
    summary_stats = s_stats.getSummaryStats(metric)
    s_stats.getHistogram(metric).show()
    print("The average inter-node distance is %d" % summary_stats.getMean())
```

## Adding Scripts to SNT

There are two ways to have your own scripts appear in SNT's *Scripts* menu. The easiest way is to go to {% include bc content='Scripts|New...'%} from the SNT dialog. This command will open an instance of Fiji's Script Editor with pre-loaded boilerplate code in the scripting language of your choice. If you save the script and then choose {% include bc content='Scripts|Reload...'%}, your new script will appear in the full list of scripts found at {% include bc content='Scripts|Full List...'%}.

Alternatively, you can save scripts into the "scripts" sub-directory under the main Fiji directory while including *SNT* in the filename (e.g., `C:\Users\user\Desktop\Fiji.app\scripts\My_SNT_Script.py` or `/home/user/Fiji.app/scripts/My_SNT_Script.py`).

Did you write a useful script? Please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/morphonets/SNT/pulls) on GitHub so that it can be distributed with Fiji\!

## Examples

### Scripting Reconstruction Viewer

Programmatic control over an open instance of [Reconstruction Viewer](SNT__Reconstruction_Viewer "wikilink") (either called from within SNT or as a standalone application) can be achieved by selecting the {% include bc content='Tools & Utilities|Script This Viewer...'%} [command](SNT__Reconstruction_Viewer#Utilities "wikilink"). It will then open an instance of Fiji's script editor with a boilerplate template containing the most essential imports and [script parameters](Script_Parameters "wikilink"). The default programming language for this template can be chosen from the drop-down menu of the *Preferred Language* [option](SNT__Reconstruction_Viewer#Settings "wikilink").

The following script exemplifies how to extend the boilerplate template to control the Viewer in real-time.

``` python
#@ Context context
#@ DatasetService ds
#@ DisplayService display
#@ ImageJ ij
#@ LegacyService ls
#@ LogService log
#@ LUTService lut
#@ SNTService snt
#@ UIService ui
