## Important Note

{% capture includecontent %} ***Please Note: This version of the
software is outdated. It will be part of Fiji for the time being, but I
highly recommend using the new [Multiview Reconstruction
Plugin](Multiview-Reconstruction "wikilink"). It is much more powerful,
flexible and completely integrated with the
[BigDataViewer](BigDataViewer "wikilink").*** {% endcapture %}

## Introduction & Overview

Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy (SPIM, [*Science*,
**305**(5686):1007-9](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/305/5686/1007))
allows *in toto* imaging of large specimens by acquiring image stacks
from multiple angles. However, to realize the full potential of these
acquisitions the data needs to be reconstructed:

We developed several algorithms for the registration and fusion of
multi-angle SPIM acquisitions. This plugin collection allows you to
reconstruct an isotropic output image from several input images, called
**views**. This process can be applied to timelapse acquisitions as
well. The complete reconstruction process is split into two parts, where
you have several choices for each step:

  - **Multi-view registration:** Aligns all views of the dataset  
      
    \* [Bead-based registration](SPIM_Bead_Registration "wikilink"):
    Uses flourescent beads to achieve the alignment. This method is very
    fast and solves timeseries registration, but relies on the
    incorporation of fluorescent beads. The plugin can be found in
    Plugins-\>SPIM Registration-\>Bead-based registration.
      - [Segmentation-based
        registration](Segmentation-based_registration "wikilink"): Uses
        structures within the sample like nuclei to achieve
        registration. It is slower and timelapse registration might be a
        sample dependent problem, but does not require any special
        sample prepration.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Multi-view fusion:** Computes the output image(s) based on the
    registration results  
      
    \* [Multi-view fusion](Multi-View_Fusion "wikilink"): Performs a
    weighted average fusion of the dataset, which includes blending
    and/or content-based weightening. The plugin can be found in
    Plugins-\>SPIM Registration-\>Multi-view fusion.
      - [Multi-view deconvolution](Multi-View_Deconvolution "wikilink"):
        Performs a multi-view deconvolution of the dataset which
        requires an estimation of the point spread function.

***Please note:*** *the SPIM registration has been rewritten and now
replaces the "old" plugin collection (Registration, Advanced
Registration, MultiChannel Registration) which has been moved to the
deprecated folder. For information regarding these outdated plugins
please refer to this
[page](SPIM_Bead_Registration_\(deprecated\) "wikilink").*

## Detailed tutorials

SPIM registration is particularly useful for processing of data acquired
on [**OpenSPIM**](http://openspim.org). Detailed step-by-step tutorials
are available on the [**OpenSPIM
wiki**](http://openspim.org/Operation#Data_processing).

  - We start by defining [**System
    requirements**](http://openspim.org/Pre-requisites) and downloading
    ['''sample OpenSPIM data](http://openspim.org/Raw_data),
  - followed by optional [**pre-processing
    steps**](http://openspim.org/Pre-processing).
  - [**Multi-view registration**](http://openspim.org/Registration) is
    at the heart of SPIMage processing pipeline.
  - [**Multi-view Fusion**](http://openspim.org/Fusion) section
    discusses how to combine several view into one output image
  - [**Time series
    registration**](http://openspim.org/Timelapse_Registration) removes
    the sample drift across long-term timelapse.

The pipeline is relatively linear as described above, we highlight the
steps where [**alternative routes
exist**](http://openspim.org/Registration#Cross-road_in_SPIM_plugins).

## How do I view fused, saved output image(s)

The fused images will be saved in the *output* directory of the dataset
as a collection of two-dimensional planes. The created output images can
be viewed for example with Plugins-\>Image5D-\>[Virtual Image 5D
Opener](https://imagej.net/plugins/image5d.html) or via the
Plugins-\>LOCI-\>[Bio-Formats
Importer](http://www.loci.wisc.edu/software/bio-formats) (check the
option *Group files with similar names*).

## Downloading example dataset

There is a 7-angle SPIM dataset of *Drosophila* available
[here](http://fly.mpi-cbg.de/preibisch/nm/HisYFP-SPIM.zip). The cropping
parameters pre-set in the plugin fit this dataset, only the appropriate
folder has to be defined.

## System requirements

Multi-view SPIM datasets are typically rather large, therefore it is
recommended to use the registration plugin on a computer with a lot of
RAM. The minimal requirement for the example dataset is **at least 4Gb**
of memory however we recommend an **16Gb+** system. You may need to
increase the Fiji memory limit by going to Edit-\>Options-\>Memory &
Threads.

## Cluster processing

See the dedicated
[page](Automated_workflow_for_parallel_Multiview_Reconstruction "wikilink")
describing an automated workflow for processing SPIM data from
Lighsheet.Z1 and OpenSPIM on the MPI-CBG cluster.
