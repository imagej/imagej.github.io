# Introduction

Image segmentation is "the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments." ([Wikipedia](wikipedia:Image_segmentation "wikilink"))

![Segmentation-overlay.jpg](/images/pages/Segmentation-overlay.jpg "Segmentation-overlay.jpg") ![Segmentation-boundaries.jpg](/images/pages/Segmentation-boundaries.jpg "Segmentation-boundaries.jpg")

It is typically used to locate *objects* and *boundaries*.

More precisely, image segmentation is the process of *assigning a label* to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain visual characteristics.

# Easy workflow

# Flexible workflow

One good workflow for segmentation in ImageJ is as follows:

1.  [ Preprocess](Segmentation#Preprocessing "wikilink") the given images
2.  Apply an [ Auto Threshold](Segmentation#Adjusting_Threshold "wikilink")
3.  Create and manipulate a [ mask](Segmentation#Creating_Masks "wikilink")
4.  [ Create and transfer](Segmentation#Selections#Creating_Selections "wikilink") a selection from a mask to your original image
5.  [ Analyze](Segmentation#Analysis "wikilink") the resulting data

## Preprocessing

Preprocess the image using filters, to make later thresholding more effective. Which filter(s) to use is highly dependent on your data, but some commonly useful filters include:

  - [Deconvolution](:Category:Deconvolution "wikilink")
  - \[https://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-29.html#sub:Subtract-Background... Subtract Background\]
  - \[https://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-29.html#sub:Gaussian-Blur... Gaussian Blur\]
  - [Find Edges](https://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-29.html#sub:Find-Edges)

## Adjusting Threshold

![Tree ring sample image with a threshold applied for a B\&W image](/images/pages/Threshold_tree.png "Tree ring sample image with a threshold applied for a B&W image")

Ideally you want to use one of the auto-threshold methods, rather than manually tweaking, so that your result is reproducible later on the same data, and on multiple other datasets.

  - Open your image
  - Select {% include bc content='Image | Adjust | Threshold...'%}
  - Specify whether or not the background should be dark or light
  - Adjust the minimum and maximum sliders until you are satisfied with the saturation level of your image
      - \[https://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-28.html#sub:Threshold...%5BT%5D More information\]

## Creating Masks

![Over-saturated mask is eroded around the center tree ring](/images/pages/Eroded_tree.png "Over-saturated mask is eroded around the center tree ring")

  - Select {% include bc content='Edit | Selection | Create Mask'%}
  - Based on the image and set threshold, some portions of the image may be over/under saturated
      - Select the portion of the image that needs to be adjusted
      - Select [Dilate](https://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-29.html#sub:Dilate) to grow the included pixels to further saturate this portion of the image or [Erode](https://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-29.html#sub:Erode) to remove saturation
          - [More information](https://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-29.html#infobox:InvertedLutMask).
  - One quick way to split overlapping objects is the [Watershed](https://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-29.html#sub:Watershed) command.

## Selections

![Selections on the mask](/images/pages/Selection_tree.png "Selections on the mask")

### Creating Selections

  - Select {% include bc content='Edit | Selection | Create Selection'%} to select the objects within the mask
  - To deselect a portion of the image, select {% include key content='Shift' %}+{% include key content='click' %}
      - [More information](https://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-27.html#sub:Create-Selection)

![Selections on the reverted image](/images/pages/Reverted_tree.png "Selections on the reverted image")

### Transferring Selections

  - Before transferring the mask's selections, revert the image to its original form by selecting {% include key content='Shift' %}+{% include key content='E' %}
  - Select first the mask, then the original image, and select {% include key content='Shift' %}+{% include key content='E' %} to transfer the mask's selections
      - [More information](https://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-27.html#infobox:TransferSelections)

## Analysis

Do some numerical analysis on the selected data:

  - \[https://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-30.html#sub:Measure...%5Bm%5D Measure\] the entire selection directly.
      - Control which measurements are done using \[https://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-30.html#sub:Set-Measurements... Set Measurements\].
  - Use \[https://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-30.html#sub:Analyze-Particles... Analyze Particles\] to extract desirable objects from your selection and report individual statistics on them.
  - Use the [ROI Manager](https://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-30.html#fig:The-ROI-Manager) to **Add** the selection and then **Split** it (under the **More** button), then use **Multi Measure** (also under **More**) to report statistics on the objects.
  - [Write a macro](Macros_Intro "wikilink") to automate this sort of analysis, loop over objects in the ROI manager, measure and manipulate them, etc.
