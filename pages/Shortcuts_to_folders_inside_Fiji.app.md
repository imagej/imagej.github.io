## Shortcuts to folders inside Fiji.app

Put Fiji.app in a folder (named for exemple "Fiji"): <img src="/images/pages/Shortcuts to folders inside Fiji.app-2.png" width="750"/>

Right click on Fiji.app and choose "Show Package Contents": <img src="/images/pages/Shortcuts to folders inside Fiji.app-3.png" width="750"/>

This will open a new window showing the folders inside Fiji.app: <img src="/images/pages/Shortcuts to folders inside Fiji.app-4.png" width="750"/>

Pressing both option (⌥) and cmd (⌘) keys, drag and drop the folders you want easy access to (here "plugins") in your "Fiji" folder, next to Fiji.app: <img src="/images/pages/Shortcuts to folders inside Fiji.app-8.png" width="750"/>

This will create an alias (labeled by a small arrow in the lower left corner of the icon) to the chosen folder: <img src="/images/pages/Shortcuts to folders inside Fiji.app-9.png" width="750"/>

Do the same drag and drop with option and cmd to make aliases of all folders inside Fiji.app you want easy access to: <img src="/images/pages/Shortcuts to folders inside Fiji.app-18.png" width="750"/>

When you will need access to those folders, for exemple the "luts" folder in the Dialog opened by {% include bc content='Color | Edit LUT | Open...'%}, you will be able to get into the folder easily using the alias: <img src="/images/pages/Shortcuts to folders inside Fiji.app-11.png" width="750"/>
