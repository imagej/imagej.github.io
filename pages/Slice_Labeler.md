This plugin is superceeded by the [Series
Labeler](Series_Labeler "wikilink")

*Copy from the website:*

This plugin adds a label in the top-left corner of each slice of a stack
or to the location of any rectangular selection. The labels are drawn in
the current foreground color. A dialog box allows the user to specify
font size for the labels, text for the body of the labels, a starting
point for a counter, the interval between frames of the counter, and the
number of digits used by the counter. The counter will be added after
the body text to identify slices or set the number of digits to zero and
no counter will be displayed.

For Example, if we have a stack with 30 slices of MRI sections of a rat
brain, running the plugin and introducing "Rat203-" as text, "1" as
starting value, "1" as increment between slices and "2" as the number of
digits, slices of the stack will be labeled as follows: "Rat203-01",
"Rat203-02", "Rat203-03"..."Rat203-30".
