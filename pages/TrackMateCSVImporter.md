# CSV to TrackMate importer.

This plugin allows for importing detections and tracks contained in CSV
files into TrackMate, or to export them as TrackMate XML file in
headless mode.

## Installation.

This plugin lives on a separate {% include list-of-update-sites
content='update site' %}. If you want to use it, you first need to
subscribe to the update site named `TrackMateCSVImporter`, as explained
[here](Following_an_update_site "wikilink").

The importer can be found in the {% include bc content='Plugins |
Tracking | TrackMate CSV importer'%} menu.

## Using the GUI.

The example below shows a capture of the GUI when re-importing a CSV
file created by TrackMate itself (from the `Analysis` button).

Open the target image in Fiji, and browse to the CSV file from the GUI.
It will be parsed and the parameter lists will be populated with the
headers of the CSV file. Some columns are mandatory (X, Y, frame). If
you uncheck `Compute all features?` box, only a minimal set of features
will be declared and computed.

Depending on whether you specify to import the track values or not, the
TrackMate GUI will be created at a different stage.

## Running the exporter from the command line.

After installation, a Jython script called `CsvToTrackMate.py` will be
addede to the `scripts` folder of your Fiji installation. It is meant to
be called in [headless mode](Headless "wikilink") to directly convert a
CSV file and an image file into a TrackMate file.

You can use Fiji in headless mode, to call the Jython script
`CsvToTrackMate.py` that will parse arguments and configure the importer
properly. Here is an example:

``` sh
./ImageJ-macosx --headless   /path/to/scripts/CsvToTrackMate.py 
    --csvFilePath="/path/to/MyCsvFile.csv" 
    --imageFilePath="/path/to/MyImage.tif"
     --xCol=1 
     --radius=2 
     --yCol=2 
     --zCol=3 
     --frameCol=0
     --targetFilePath="/path/to/TrackMateFile.xml"
```

This will create a new TrackMate file `/path/to/TrackMateFile.xml` with
detections created from the CSV file `/path/to/MyCsvFile.csv` and
reading the image metadata from image file `/path/to/MyImage.tif`.
