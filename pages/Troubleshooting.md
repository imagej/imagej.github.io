# How to troubleshoot problems

## Checking the Java version

You can tell which Java version ImageJ is using by clicking the ImageJ
[status bar](status_bar "wikilink") and looking for the part that says
e.g. "Java 1.8.0\_45 \[64-bit\]". The relevant number is the one after
"Java 1."—so e.g. "Java 1.8.0\_45" or similar indicates Java 8, while
"Java 1.7.0\_79" or similar indicates Java 7.

On OS X, you can use [this
script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ctrueden/ctr-scripts/master/java-info)
to diagnose which versions of Java are installed on your system.

See also [How do I launch ImageJ with a different version of
Java?](Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_do_I_launch_ImageJ_with_a_different_version_of_Java.3F "wikilink").

## Launching ImageJ from the console

To diagnose problems with ImageJ, it is often helpful to launch it in
debug mode:

  - ![Tux.png](/images/pages/Tux.png "Tux.png")" On Linux 64-bit (from a console):
    ``` bash
    DEBUG=1 $HOME/ImageJ.app/ImageJ-linux64
    ```
  - ![Osx.png](/images/pages/Osx.png "Osx.png")" On OS X (from Terminal):
    ``` bash
    DEBUG=1 /Applications/ImageJ.app/Contents/MacOS/ImageJ-macosx
    ```
  - ![Win.png](/images/pages/Win.png "Win.png")" On Windows 64-bit:
      - Make a copy of `ImageJ-win64.exe` called `debug.exe`
      - Run `debug.exe`

### If you need more control

You can control the log level more precisely by setting the
`scijava.log.level` system property. E.g., on Linux:

``` bash
$HOME/ImageJ.app/ImageJ-linux64 -Dscijava.log.level=trace --
```

Valid levels include: `none`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug` and
`trace`. See the [Logging](Logging "wikilink") page for more about
SciJava logging.

## The other debug mode

There is another debug mode, which can be enabled in the {% include bc
content='Edit | Options | Misc...' %} menu, by checking *Debug mode*.
This might reveal different information than using the techniques
described above. For maximum debugitude, turn on both\!

## If ImageJ freezes or hangs

If ImageJ appears to
[hang](wikipedia:Hang_\(computing\) "wikilink")—i.e., it stops
responding to inputs—it is often helpful to take a "snapshot" of where
the program is at after the hang occurs. This information can give the
developers valuable hints about how to fix the problem.

There are two ways to create such a snapshot, known as a "thread dump"
or "stack trace".

### The easy way

1.  Press {% include key content='Shift' %}+{% include key content='\\'
    %} in ImageJ itself. If successful, it will open a new window with
    the stack trace.
2.  Press {% include key content='Ctrl|A' %} to select it, then {%
    include key content='Ctrl|C' %} to copy it to the clipboard.

### The fallback way

If the first method does not work, and you can reproduce the hang:

1.  Launch ImageJ again, this time [from the
    console](#Launching_ImageJ_from_the_console "wikilink") as described
    above.
      - ![Win.png](/images/pages/Win.png "Win.png")" On Windows, you will need to
        download and run [this batch
        file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imagej/imagej/master/bin/ImageJ.bat),
        which launches ImageJ with an attached Command Prompt window.
2.  Generate and copy the stack trace:
      - ![Osx.png](/images/pages/Osx.png "Osx.png")" ![Tux.png](/images/pages/Tux.png "Tux.png")" On
        non-Windows platforms:
        1.  Press {% include key content='Ctrl|\\' %} in the console
            window to print the stack trace.
        2.  Select the stack trace by dragging with the left mouse
            button.
        3.  Right click and select "Copy" to copy it to the clipboard.
      - ![Win.png](/images/pages/Win.png "Win.png")" On Windows:
        1.  Press {% include key content='Ctrl|Pause' %} in the Command
            Prompt window to print the stack trace. (**Note:** this
            shortcut actually uses the [Break
            key](Wikipedia:Break_key "wikilink"))
        2.  Click the Command Prompt icon in the upper left corner of
            the window, and choose {% include bc content='Edit|Mark' %}.
        3.  Select the stack trace by dragging with the left mouse
            button.
        4.  Press {% include key content='Enter' %} to copy it to the
            clipboard.

Once you have the stack trace. you can paste it into a [bug
report](Bugs "wikilink")\!

## If ImageJ crashes

If ImageJ [crashes](wikipedia:Crash_\(computing\) "wikilink")—i.e., the
program suddenly terminates, with or without an error message—it is very
helpful to identify the steps which can reliably reproduce the crash:

  - Launch ImageJ [from the
    console](#Launching_ImageJ_from_the_console "wikilink") as described
    above.
  - Perform the same actions which previously resulted in the crash.
  - Take note of any error messages in the console window, which you can
    copy and paste it into a [bug report](Bugs "wikilink").

## If ImageJ does not start up

### On a fresh installation

![Win.png](/images/pages/Win.png "Win.png")" On some 32-bit Windows systems, ImageJ may
initially request more memory than Windows can handle. If you launch
ImageJ in debug mode (see above), and receive a message like:

    Could not reserve enough space for 1253376KB object heap

Then you can try the following:

  - Run Notepad
  - Paste in the following:
        .
        jre\bin\javaw.exe
        -Xmx512m -cp ij.jar ij.ImageJ
  - Save the file as `ImageJ.cfg` in your `ImageJ.app` (or `Fiji.app`)
    installation.
      - Note that by default, Windows hides file extensions; you may
        need to [show file
        extensions](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/show-hide-file-name-extensions)
        before you can successfully name the file `ImageJ.cfg` as
        required.
  - Try running `ImageJ-win32.exe` again.

You can replace the `512m` with however many megabytes of memory you
wish to give to ImageJ.

### After running the updater

If the ImageJ window never appears after launching the program, the
installation may be corrupted. While the developers of ImageJ make a
serious effort to prevent this problem from happening, it is still
possible after running the {% include bc content='Help | Update...' %}
command, due to bugs in the [Updater](Updater "wikilink").

The easiest workaround is to [download](download "wikilink") a fresh
copy of the software.

If you are feeling investigative, you can try [launching ImageJ from the
console](#Launching_ImageJ_from_the_console "wikilink") to get more
information about why it is failing to start up. After doing that, you
will probably see some information printed to the console, which you can
paste online to somewhere like [Pastebin.com](http://pastebin.com/), and
write to the [Community](Community "wikilink") to ask for help
deciphering it.

## Advanced debugging techniques

If you are technically savvy, check out the
[Debugging](Debugging "wikilink") page for additional—but more
complicated—debugging techniques.

# Common issues

## The image I loaded is displayed all black\! But it is not black\!

This problem can arise when 12-bit, 14-bit or 16-bit images are loaded
into ImageJ without autoscaling. In that case, the display is scaled to
the full 16-bit range (0 - 65535 intensity values), even though the
actual data values typically span a much smaller range. For example, on
a 12-bit camera, the largest possible intensity value is 4095—but with 0
mapped to black and 65535 mapped to white, 4095 ends up (linearly)
mapped to a very very dark gray, nearly invisible to the human eye.

You can fix this by clicking on {% include bc content='Image | Adjust |
Brightness/Contrast...' %} and hitting the *Auto* button.

You can verify whether the actual data is there by moving the mouse over
the image, and looking at the pixel probe output in the [status bar area
of the main ImageJ window](Getting_Started#The_status_bar "wikilink").

## The image colors do not match what I see in other programs\! ImageJ is wrong\!

In many cases, ImageJ performs autoscaling by default, to improve the
contrast of your image. Otherwise, in many cases with scientific images
you might see only a black square (see previous question).

You can override the autoscaling using the
[Brightness/Contrast](https://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-28.html#sub:Adjust)
dialog.

It is important to understand that [your image is a collection of
samples, each of which has a numerical intensity
value](Principles#What_are_pixel_values.3F "wikilink"). The unit of
these values is rather arbitrary and unspecified, depending on the type
and calibration of your detector. Your file is stored with a certain
[bit depth](https://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-7.html#toc-Section-7),
meaning these intensities can range from 0 (no light detected) to a
particular maximum value (the most light the detector is capable of
detecting). For example, 8-bit images have a maximum value of 255,
whereas 16-bit images have a maximum of 65535. In practice though,
especially with higher bit depths, your detector will not typically
record sample intensities across that entire range of values (and if it
does record a significant number of values at the maximum, you probably
oversaturated your detector, which will skew your analysis\!).

Because the full range of values is typically much less than the
maximum—e.g., in the case of a 12-bit detector the actual maximum
range is 0-4095, and often even smaller in practice—ImageJ performs
**autoscaling** to show you a meaningful or "pretty good" image by
default, which is not just a black square (see previous question). That
is: it maps the darkest actual intensity in your data to black, and the
brightest actual intensity in your data to white. You can override this
mapping using the
[Brightness/Contrast](https://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-28.html#sub:Adjust)
dialog under the {% include bc content='Image | Adjust' %} menu
(shortcut: {% include key content='shift' %}+{% include key content='C'
%}).

Alternately, to disable autoscaling during initial import, you can use
the [Bio-Formats](Bio-Formats "wikilink") plugin to import your data
with the "Autoscale" option turned off:

  - {% include bc content='File | Import | Bio-Formats' %}
  - Choose your file
  - Uncheck the "Autoscale" box
  - Click OK
  - The data will be scaled to match the maximum of the bit depth,
    rather than autoscaled.

## Whenever I open a file in ImageJ, the file size increases by a ridiculous amount\!

Are you using a [compressed
format](https://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-7.html#sub:Native-Formats)
such as JPEG, PNG or ZIP? The file size on disk is smaller than the size
of the pixels in memory. ImageJ reports this true (uncompressed) size of
the image in the subtitle bar of the image window. For example: an
uncompressed image of 16000 pixels x 16000 pixels x 32 bit (RGBA) will
occupy 976 MB in memory.

Note that [lossy compression is not suitable for quantitative image
analysis](Principles#Why_.28lossy.29_JPEGs_should_not_be_used_in_imaging "wikilink").

## The same plugin gives different results on different machines\!

While ImageJ strives for [reproducible](reproducible "wikilink")
analysis, there are many reasons results can differ. Check the
following:

  - Ensure that the version of [ImageJ](ImageJ "wikilink") is exactly
    the same on both machines.
      - Click the [status bar](status_bar "wikilink") and you will see
        something like "ImageJ 2.0.0-rc-26/1.49p".
      - If these two values differ between your machines, the versions
        are not the same.
      - See also [How can I verify that my ImageJ is really 100% up to
        date?](Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_can_I_verify_that_my_ImageJ_is_really_100%_up_to_date? "wikilink").
      - If the two versions of ImageJ match but produce different
        numerical results, it is a bug—please [report
        it](Report_a_Bug "wikilink")\!
  - Ensure that the *options* of ImageJ match between the machines.
      - A fast way to ensure this is the {% include bc content='Edit |
        Options | Reset...' %} command, which resets everything to its
        default state.
      - Alternately, you can check the settings in the following dialog
        boxes:
          - All {% include bc content='Edit | Options' %} dialog boxes
      - {% include bc content='Process | Binary | Options...' %} – a
        very common culprit of black-vs.-white issues is the "Black
        background" option.
      - {% include bc content='Process | FFT | FFT Options...' %}
      - {% include bc content='Image | Overlay | Overlay Options...' %}
      - {% include bc content='Analyze | Gels | Gel Analyzer Options...'
        %}
      - Press L for the [Command Finder](Command_Finder "wikilink") and
        type "options" and double check any other options you think
        might be relevant.
  - If you are running your analysis [headless](headless "wikilink"),
    there might be a bug in the headless support.
      - Try the analysis *headless* on both machines and see if the
        results match.
      - Try the analysis *headless* vs. through the GUI on a single
        machine, and see if the results match.
      - If the results differ due to headlessness, it is a bug—please
        [report it](Report_a_Bug "wikilink")\!

# Common error messages

## OutOfMemoryError

{% capture includecontent %} float=right | **Why does ImageJ not release
any memory back to the system?**

This is a characteristic of the Java runtime. In many cases, Java
*never* releases memory back to the system, so memory monitors such as
Windows Task Manager will always report an ever-growing amount of RAM
used by the Java process, until the JVM shuts down.

The best way to monitor ImageJ's actual memory usage is to run the
[Monitor
Memory...](https://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-31.html#toc-Subsubsection-31.3.5)
command. You can also click on the ImageJ [status
bar](status_bar "wikilink") to trigger a garbage collection operation,
which will typically decrease the memory use.

That said, some articles suggest that you can cause Java to give back
free memory to the OS under certain conditions; see:

  - [Java still uses system memory after deallocation of objects and
    garbage collection](http://stackoverflow.com/q/324499)
  - [java.exe process uses more memory and does not free it
    up](http://stackoverflow.com/q/16649601)
  - [JVM Memory : Why memory on task manager difference with JProbe (or
    JConsole tool)](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12017437)

To be clear, Java does reuse memory when you close and reopen images.
The behavior described above is not a memory *leak* per se. It should be
possible to leave ImageJ running for days or weeks at a time doing batch
processing and it have it work just fine.

See also:

  - [Automatically release unused memory in ImageJ /
    Fiji](http://stackoverflow.com/q/22912063)

{% endcapture %}

{% include sidebox-right content=includecontent %}

The error means ImageJ ran out of available [computer
memory](wikipedia:Random-access_memory "wikilink") (*not* hard drive
space).

The first thing to do is make sure that ImageJ has a large enough
"maximum heap" size:

  - {% include bc content='Edit | Options | Memory & Threads' %}
  - Change "Maximum Memory" to something larger (at most, 1000 MB less
    than your computer's total RAM).
  - Restart ImageJ for the new memory settings to take effect.

Note that in most cases, the [ImageJ launcher](Launcher "wikilink") will
make an initial guess at a reasonable value: \~75% of physical RAM.

You can confirm how much memory is actually available by clicking on the
[status bar](status_bar "wikilink"). You will see a "\[used\] of
\[max\]" memory message, as pictured here:

![MemoryStatus.png](/images/pages/MemoryStatus.png "MemoryStatus.png")"

If you are already at the limits of your computer's physical memory, the
next step would be to add more.

**If setting this value somehow has no effect:** Check for an
[environment variable](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm)
called `_JAVA_OPTIONS` or similar, which is overriding the value. If the
variable exists, change the memory value there, or remove the variable
completely.

**About Java garbage collection:** Java always automatically calls the
garbage collector when the heap is getting full
[\[1](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8719071)\]. While it is
possible to manually invoke the garbage collector by clicking ImageJ's
[status bar](status_bar "wikilink")—or programmatically by calling
`run("Collect Garbage")` in a macro or `System.gc()` in a plugin—it will
not solve the fundamental problem of Java actually not having a
sufficient amount of memory. (The only exception to this is a rare case
where Java decides that garbage collection is happening too slowly, in
which case you should see the message "GC overhead limit exceeded"
[\[2](http://www.petefreitag.com/item/746.cfm)\]).

## NegativeArraySizeException

This error usually means that your image planes are larger than the
maximum supported size.

[ImageJ1](ImageJ1 "wikilink") only supports image planes with **2
gigapixels** (2^31 = 2147483648 pixels; in case of a square image, the
maximum allowed is 46340 x 46340 pixels) or less. If your data has
extremely large image planes—e.g., 50000 x 50000 pixels—you may need to
analyze region by region. One way to do this is using the "Crop on
import" feature of the [Bio-Formats](Bio-Formats "wikilink") plugin.

If you are using Bio-Formats to open a file, however, the size limit is
a bit more complicated. Instead of using `short[]` as in ImageJ1,
Bio-Formats store data in `byte[]` when reading planes. If the source
image is in 16 bit or in 32 bit (4 bytes, eg. floating point TIFF), the
maximum pixel numbers allowed per plane will be 1/2 (1 gigapixels) or
1/4 (0.5 gigapixels), respectively.

[ImageJ2](ImageJ2 "wikilink") supports larger image planes internally,
but uses the [ImageJ1](ImageJ1 "wikilink") user interface by default,
which once again limits visualization to 2 gigapixels. The [ImageJ2
team](Contributors "wikilink") is working to lift these size
restrictions; see {% include github org='imagej' repo='imagej'
issue='87' label='imagej/imagej\#87' %}.

## UnsupportedClassVersionError

Usually, this error takes the form of "Unsupported major.minor version
52.0" or similar, and indicates you are attempting to use a plugin which
requires a newer version of Java than you are running. For example, you
may have enabled an [update site](update_site "wikilink") that requires
Java 7, but your ImageJ is using Java 6.

Check which version of Java is being used by ImageJ; see [Checking the
Java version](#Checking_the_Java_version "wikilink") above.

The number given in the `UnsupportedClassVersionError` error messages is
an internal code, which translates to Java versions as follows:

| Internal code | Java version |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| 45.0          | JDK 1.1      |
| 46.0          | J2SE 1.2     |
| 47.0          | J2SE 1.3     |
| 48.0          | J2SE 1.4     |
| 49.0          | J2SE 5.0     |
| 50.0          | Java SE 6    |
| 51.0          | Java SE 7    |
| 52.0          | Java SE 8    |

See [Java version history](wikipedia:Java_version_history "wikilink")
for more information about these different versions.

To control the version of Java that ImageJ uses, see [How do I launch
ImageJ with a different version of
Java](Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_do_I_launch_ImageJ_with_a_different_version_of_Java.3F "wikilink").

## NoSuchMethodError or NoClassDefFoundError

These errors indicate a "version skew" between the software libraries in
your ImageJ installation. Most commonly, this situation occurs when
multiple [update sites](update_sites "wikilink") are enabled which ship
incompatible versions of those libraries.

The proper fix is for the maintainers of those update sites to reconcile
the versions somehow, but as a user you can work around the issue in the
meantime by disabling the problematic update site(s). Start from a fresh
download of ImageJ, enabling the update sites you want one by one,
testing your workflow each time. Once you determine which update site(s)
causes the issue, you can create a separate copy of ImageJ with only the
problematic site(s) enabled. Although you will no longer have a single
ImageJ with all desired functionality enabled, keeping isolated
installations will let you continue using all the plugins you need by
launching each appropriate copy of ImageJ.
