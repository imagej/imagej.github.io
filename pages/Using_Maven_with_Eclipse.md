To take full advantage of a Maven-based project from within Eclipse, you
should install the Maven plugin according to these steps. Please note
that you must be using Eclipse 3.5 or newer.

For more information about Maven, see:

  - [Maven web site](http://maven.apache.org/)
  - [Maven: The Complete
    Reference](http://www.sonatype.com/books/mvnref-book/reference/public-book.html)
  - [Better Builds with
    Maven](http://www.maestrodev.com/better-builds-with-maven/0-about-this-guide)

## Install m2eclipse

**Note:** if you use Eclipse 3.7 Indigo or newer, you most likely have
m2e already. If your  offers you a *Maven* section, you have it, and can
skip the rest of this section.

  - From the Eclipse menu, choose 
  - Click the Add button to add an update site:
      - Name: m2eclipse
      - Location: <http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e>
      - Click OK
  - Check the item that appears—Maven Integration for Eclipse—and click
    Next.
  - Click Next again, accept the license terms, and click Finish.
  - Restart Eclipse.

## Configure Eclipse (Windows only)

On Windows, you will need to configure Eclipse to use the Java
Development Kit (JDK).

First, download and install JDK 6 from the Java web site.

Take note of where the Java installation ended up; we will use
"C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.6.0\_20" below, though your path is
likely to be different.

Also take note of the path to your Eclipse installation; we will use
"C:\\Users\\you\\Programs\\eclipse" though your path is likely to be
different.

Open the file "C:\\Users\\you\\Programs\\eclipse\\eclipse.ini" in a text
editor, and follow [these
instructions](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse.ini#Specifying_the_JVM) to
specify the JVM using the "-vm" flag. Be careful to follow the
instructions exactly.

Now update Eclipse's JRE to be JDK-aware:

  - Launch Eclipse
  - From the menu choose 
  - Select 
  - Click Search..., navigate to "C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.6.0\_20"
    and click OK
  - Check the box next to the JDK that appears and click OK

## Troubleshooting

### On Mac OS X, behind a firewall

I ([Jean-Yves](JeanYvesTinevez "wikilink") speaking) noticed a very
annoying problem. At work, I live behind a firewall, and whatever I did,
the version of maven shipped with Eclipse (Indigo or Juno) never managed
to reach out the outside world (even tweaking proxy configuration). This
resulted in the impossibility to import any maven project.

One solution that worked for me was to configure Eclipse no to use the
maven version it shipped. Instead, I used the one shipped with
[fink](http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/package.php/maven) accessible from
the command line, and with a system proxy configured correctly.
