## **Description:**

Vessel Analysis is a plugin to automatically calculate vascular density
metrics: - vascular density = vessel area/total area \* 100% - vascular
length density = skeletonized vessel area/total area \* 100%)

as well as making diameter measurements for multiple vessels in RGB
images of vascular networks. It can also be used on any images of
branching structures.

## **Installation:**

Vessel Analysis can be added to Fiji (version 1.47g or higher required).

Download the [Vessel
Analysis.zip](https://imagej.net/File:Vessel_Analysis.zip) package and
save an unzipped copy in Fiji's Plugins folder. Open a new session in
Fiji and you should now see Vessel Analysis listed near the bottom of
the Plugins drop down menu.

Before using the plugin, make sure your version of Fiji comes
pre-downloaded with the Auto Threshold and Geometry to Distance plugins.
They should be listed under: o Image \> Adjust \> Auto Threshold o
Analyze \> Local Thickness \> Geometry to Distance Map

Also make sure you install [Mexican Hat
Filter](https://imagej.net/plugins/mexican-hat/index.html) plugin

## **Usage:**

Detailed Instructions
[HERE](https://imagej.net/File:Vessel_Analysis_User_Manual.pdf)

Open a multi-channel image in Fiji and execute the Vessel Analysis
plugin via Plugins \> Vessel Analysis \> Vessel Analysis (complete). The
"complete" program will guide you through preprocessing steps to prepare
the image for vascular density and diameter measurements.

*Using the Plugin: Pre-processing*

You may skip directly to Vessel Analysis \> Vascular Density or Vessel
Analysis \> Diameter Measurements if you already have the appropriate
pre-processed image.

As the image is processed, new images will be generated and
automatically saved in the source directory of the original image. You
may re-use these images for future processing.

*Vessel Analysis (complete)* Using the rectangular selection tool, you
will be asked to select the image area you would like to analyze. Once
complete, click OK. A cropped image will be generated, followed by its
binary version. The following measurements will be collected using this
binary image.

*Choose a metric...*

You will now be prompted to perform either vascular density or diameter
measurements. At the end of each individual program, you can choose to
analyze the other metric as well.
